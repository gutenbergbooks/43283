<h2>CORRESPONDENCE OF MADAME,<br />
    <br />
    <span class="mf">ÉLISABETH-CHARLOTTE, PRINCESS PALATINE,</span><br />
    <span class="sf">MOTHER OF THE REGENT.</span></h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION BY C.-A. SAINTE-BEUVE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I am very frank and very natural, and I say all that I
    have in my heart.&rdquo; That is the motto that ought to be
    placed upon the correspondence of Madame, which was
    chiefly written in German and published from time to time
    in voluminous extracts at Strasburg and beyond the Rhine.
    This correspondence, translated by fragments, was made into
    a volume and called, very improperly, the &ldquo;Memoirs of
    Madame.&rdquo; Coming after other memoirs of the celebrated
    women of the great century, it ran singularly counter to
    them in tone, and caused great surprise. Now that the
    Memoirs of Saint-Simon have been published in full, I will
    not say that the pages of the chronicle we owe to Madame
    have paled, but they have ceased to astonish. They are now
    recognized as good, naïve pictures, somewhat forced in colour,
    rather coarse in feature, exaggerated and grimacing at
    times, but on the whole good likenesses. The right method
    for judging of Madame&rsquo;s correspondence, and thus of gaining
    insight to the history of that period, is to see how Madame
    wrote, and in what spirit; also what she herself was by
    nature and by education. For this purpose the letters published <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> by M. Menzel in German, and translated by M. Brunet,
    are of great assistance to a knowledge of this singular and
    original personage; to understand her properly it is not too
    much to say that Germany and France must be combined.</p>
<p>Élisabeth-Charlotte, who married in 1671 Monsieur,
    brother of Louis XIV., was born at Heidelberg in 1652.
    Her father, Charles-Louis, was that Elector of the Palatinate
    who was restored to his States by the Peace of Westphalia.
    From childhood Élisabeth-Charlotte was noted for
    her lively mind, and her frank, open, vigorous nature.
    Domestic peace had never reigned about the hearth of the
    Elector-Palatine; he had a mistress, whom he married by
    the left hand, and the mother of Élisabeth-Charlotte is
    accused of having caused the separation by her crabbed
    temper. The young girl was confided to the care of her
    aunt Sophia, Electress of Hanover, a person of merit, for
    whom she always retained the feelings and gratitude of a
    loving daughter. To her she addressed her longest and most
    confidential letters, which would certainly surpass in interest
    those that are published, but M. Menzel states that it is not
    known what became of them. All that part of the life and
    youth of Madame would be curious and very useful to
    recover. &ldquo;I was too old,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;when I came to France
    to change my character; the foundations were laid.&rdquo; While
    subjecting herself with courage and resolution to the duties
    of her new position she kept her German tastes; she confesses
    them and proclaims them before all Versailles and
    all Marly; and the Court, then the arbiter of Europe, to
    which it set the tone, would certainly have been shocked if
    it had not preferred to smile.</p>
<p>From Marly after forty-three years&rsquo; residence in France,
    Madame writes (November 22, 1714): &ldquo;I cannot endure
    coffee, chocolate, or tea, and I do not understand how any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> one can like them; a good dish of sauerkraut and smoked
    sausages is, to my mind, a feast for a king, to which nothing
    is preferable; cabbage soup with lard suits me much better
    than all the delicacies they dote on here.&rdquo; In the commonest
    and most every-day things she finds another and a poorer
    taste than in Germany. &ldquo;The butter and milk,&rdquo; she says,
    after fifty years&rsquo; residence, &ldquo;are not as good as ours; they
    have no flavour and taste like water. The cabbages are not
    good either, for the soil is not rich, but light and sandy,
    so that vegetables have no strength and the cows cannot give
    good milk. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> how I should like to eat the dishes
    your cook prepares for you; they would be more to my taste
    than those my <i>maître-d&rsquo;hôtel</i> serves up to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she clung to her own country, her German stock, her
    &ldquo;Rhin allemand,&rdquo; by other memories than those of food and
    the national cooking. She loved nature, the country, a free
    life, even a wild one; the impressions of her childhood returned
    to her in whiffs of freshness. Apropos of Heidelberg, rebuilt
    after the disasters, and of a convent of Jesuits, or Franciscans,
    established on the heights, &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; she cries,
    &ldquo;how many times I have eaten cherries on that mountain,
    with a good bit of bread, at five in the morning! I was
    gayer then than I am to-day.&rdquo; The brisk air of Heidelberg
    is with her after fifty years&rsquo; absence; and she speaks of it a
    few months before her death to the half-sister Louise, to
    whom she writes: &ldquo;There is not in all the world a better
    air than that of Heidelberg; above all, about the château
    where my apartment is; nothing better can be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Germany, on the banks of the Neckar and the Rhine,
    Élisabeth-Charlotte enjoyed the picturesque sites, her rambles
    through the forests, Nature left to herself, and also the spots
    of bourgeois plenty amid the wilder environment. &ldquo;I love
    trees and fields more than the finest palaces; I like a kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> garden better than a garden with statues and fountains; a
    brook pleases me a great deal more than sumptuous cascades;
    in a word, all that is natural is infinitely more to my taste
    than works of art or magnificence; the latter only please at
    first sight; as soon as one is accustomed to them they fatigue,
    and we care no more about them.&rdquo; In France she was particularly
    fond of residing at Saint-Cloud, where she enjoyed
    Nature with greater liberty. At Fontainebleau she often
    walked out on foot and went a league through the forest.
    On her arrival in France and first appearance at Court, she
    told her physician when presented to her that &ldquo;she did not
    need him; she had never been bled or purged, and when she
    did not feel well she always walked six miles on foot, which
    cured her.&rdquo; Mme. de Sévigné who relates this, seems to
    conclude, with the majority of the Court, that the new
    Madame was overcome with her grandeur and spoke like a
    person who is not accustomed to such surroundings. Mme.
    de Sévigné is mistaken; Madame was in no degree overcome
    by her greatness. She felt herself born for the high rank of
    Monsieur&rsquo;s wife, and would have felt in her right place if
    higher still. But Mme. de Sévigné though she herself
    walked with pleasure in her woods at Livry and her park
    des Rochers, did not divine the proud young girl, so brusque
    and wild, who ate with delight her bit of bread and cherries
    plucked from the trees at five in the morning on the hills of
    Heidelberg.</p>
<p>Madame&rsquo;s marriage was not made to please her. In
    France this has been concealed; in Germany it was said
    quite plainly. Her father, the Elector, hoped by this alliance
    to buy the safety of his dominions, always threatened by
    the French. Like a pious daughter she obeyed; but she
    could not refrain from saying: &ldquo;I am the political lamb,
    about to be sacrificed for my country.&rdquo; The <i>lamb</i>, after we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> once know her, seems a singular term to choose for so
    vigorous a victim; but the comparison is just, all the same,
    so tender and good was the heart within her.</p>
<p>The rôle that Madame conceived for herself in France
    was that of preserving her native country from the horrors
    of war, and of being useful to it in the different schemes
    which agitated the Court of France and might in the end
    overthrow it. In this she failed; and the failure was to her
    a poignant grief. She was even made the innocent cause
    of fresh disasters to the land she loved when, on the
    death of her father and her brother (who left no children),
    Louis XIV. set up a claim to the Palatinate on her account.
    Instead of bringing pledges and guarantees of peace, she
    found herself a pretext and a means for war. The devastation
    and the too famous incendiarism of the Palatinate
    which the struggles of ambition brought about caused her
    inexpressible grief. &ldquo;When I think of those flames, shudders
    run over me. Every time I try to go to sleep I see Heidelberg
    on fire, and I start up in bed, so that I am almost ill
    in consequence.&rdquo; She speaks of this incessantly, and bleeds
    and weeps for it after many years. For Louvois she retained
    an eternal hatred. &ldquo;I suffer bitter pain,&rdquo; she writes
    thirty years later (November 3, 1718), &ldquo;when I think of all
    that M. de Louvois burned up in the Palatinate; I believe
    he is burning terribly in the other world, for he died so
    suddenly he had no time to repent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame&rsquo;s virtue in this and other conjunctures was in
    being faithful to France and to Louis XIV., all the while
    torn by distress within her secret self. She never ceases
    to interest herself in the fate of her unhappy country, and
    in its resurrection after so many disasters. &ldquo;I love that
    prince,&rdquo; she said of the Elector of another branch which
    was reigning in 1718, &ldquo;because he loves the Palatinate. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> can easily imagine how pained he was when he saw how
    little remained in the ruins of Heidelberg; the tears come
    into my eyes when I think of it, and I am so sad.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
    she regrets the religious bickerings and persecutions
    introduced into the country, and her own powerlessness to
    intervene for the protection of those who are persecuted.
    &ldquo;I see but too plainly now,&rdquo; she writes in 1719, &ldquo;that God
    did not will that I should accomplish any good in France,
    for, in spite of my efforts, I have never been able to be useful
    to my native country. It is true that when I came to
    France it was purely in obedience to my father, my uncle,
    and my aunt, the Electress of Hanover; my inclination did
    in nowise bring me here.&rdquo; Thus, in the marriage, apparently
    so brilliant, which she contracted with the brother of Louis
    XIV. Madame cared for one thing only, namely, to serve
    and protect her German land from French policy; and on
    that very side where politics (to which she was always a
    stranger) touched her most, she had the grief of failing.</p>
<p>When the marriage of Élisabeth-Charlotte was negotiated,
    it became a question of converting her. The erudite and
    witty Chévreau, who was at the Court of the Elector Palatine
    in the capacity of councillor, flattered himself that he contributed
    to that result by daily interviews with her of four
    hours in length for three weeks. One of the orators who
    eulogized Madame at the time of her death, her almoner
    (the Abbé de Saint-Géri de Magnas), said as to this: &ldquo;When
    asked in marriage for Monsieur by Louis XIV. the principal
    condition was that she should embrace the Catholic religion.
    Neither ambition nor levity had any share in this change;
    the respect and tenderness she felt for Mme. la Princesse
    Palatine, her aunt, who was Catholic, prevented her from
    refusing to be instructed. She listened to Père Jourdain, a
    Jesuit. Born with the rectitude which distinguished her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> all her life, she did not resist the truth. Her abjuration was
    made at Metz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame was, in truth, perfectly sincere in her conversion;
    nevertheless, she carried into it something of her freedom
    of mind and her independence of temper. &ldquo;On my arrival
    in France,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;they made me hold conferences about
    religion with three bishops. All three differed in their
    beliefs; I took the quintessence of their opinions and formed
    my own.&rdquo; In this catholic religion, thus defined in the
    rough, which she believed and practised in perfect good faith,
    there remained traces and several of the habits of her early
    faith. She continued to read the Bible in German. She
    mentions that at that period in France scarcely any one, even
    among the devout, read Holy Scripture. The translations
    recently made of it had led to such discussions and bitter
    quarrels that the ecclesiastical authority intervened and
    forbade the reading of them; which has ever since remained
    a rarity in our country. Madame was therefore a notable
    exception when, in her plan of life, she gave a great and
    regular place to meditation on the Holy Book. She selected
    three days in the week for that salutary practice. &ldquo;After
    my son&rsquo;s visit,&rdquo; she writes (November, 1717), &ldquo;I sat down to
    table, and after dinner I took my Bible and read four chapters
    of the book of Job, four Psalms, and two chapters of Saint
    John, leaving the other two till this morning.&rdquo; And she
    might have written the same thing on each of her appointed
    days. On one occasion she was singing unconsciously the
    Calvinist psalms, or the Lutheran canticles (for she mixed
    them up), while walking alone in the Orangery at Versailles,
    when a painter who was at work on a scaffolding
    came down hurriedly and threw himself at her feet, saying
    with gratitude: &ldquo;Is it possible, Madame, that you
    still remember our Psalms?&rdquo; The painter was a reformer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> and afterwards a refugee; she relates the little story very
    touchingly.</p>
<p>She had nothing of the sectarian spirit. She blamed
    Luther for wishing to make a separate Church; he ought
    to have confined himself, she thought, to attacking abuses.
    She retained from him and from other reformers, in spite of
    her conversion, a habit of invective against religious Orders
    of all kinds; and on this subject she bursts into tirades
    which are less those of a woman than of a pedant of the
    sixteenth century or some doctor emancipated from the rue
    Saint-Jacques. Gui Patin in a farthingale could not have
    expressed himself differently. She corresponded with Leibnitz,
    who assured her that she wrote German &ldquo;not badly;&rdquo;
    which pleased her much, for she could not endure, she says,
    to see Germans despising and ignoring their mother tongue.
    The letters that she wrote to Leibnitz would be precious
    could they some day be recovered and published. She may
    have gladly borrowed from that illustrious philosopher his
    idea of an approach and fusion, a reconciliation, in short,
    between the principal Christian communities, for she renders
    it, rather brusquely as her manner was, when she says: &ldquo;If
    they followed my advice all the sovereigns would give orders
    that among all Christians, without distinction of beliefs,
    people were to abstain from insulting expressions, and that
    each and all were to believe and practise as they saw fit.&rdquo;
    In the midst of that Court of Louis XIV., which was so
    unanimous as to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, she
    retained the most inviolable ideas of tolerance. &ldquo;It is not
    showing themselves in any way Christian,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to torture
    people for religious reasons, and I think it monstrous;
    but when one examines things to the bottom we find that
    religion is only a pretext; all is done from policy and selfish
    interests. They are serving Mammon, and not God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>Later, she humanely intercedes with her son, the regent,
    to release from the galleys the Reformers who had been sent
    there. But as it is in Madame&rsquo;s temperament to exaggerate
    everything, even her own good qualities, and to introduce a
    sort of incoherence into her efforts, she goes far beyond her
    object when she expresses the wish that she may see in the
    galleys, in the place of such poor innocents, those who she
    thinks have persecuted them, and also other monks, especially
    the Spanish monks, who resisted to the last in Barcelona the
    accession of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s grandson. &ldquo;They preached in
    all the streets that no one should surrender; and if I had
    my way those rascals would have gone to the galleys in
    place of the poor Reformers who are languishing there.&rdquo;
    That is Madame&mdash;in all her goodness of heart, extravagance
    of language, and her frank, sincere religion of a mixed
    nature.</p>
<p>When she arrived in France at the age of nineteen no
    one expected all this. The Court was filled with memories
    and regrets for the late Madame, the amiable Henrietta,
    snatched away in the bloom of her charm and grace.
    &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cries Mme. de Sévigné, speaking of the new-comer,
    &ldquo;alas! if <i>this</i> Madame could only represent to us her whom
    we have lost!&rdquo; In place of a blithesome fairy and a being
    of enchantment, what was it that suddenly appeared before
    them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; says Saint-Simon, &ldquo;was a princess of the olden
    time; attached to honour, virtue, rank, grandeur, and inexorable
    as to their observances. She was not without
    intellect; and what she saw she saw very well. A good and
    faithful friend, trusty, true, and upright; easy to prejudice
    and shock; very difficult to bring back from prejudice;
    coarse, and dangerous in her public outbursts; very German
    in her habits; frank, indifferent to all propriety and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> delicacy for herself and for others; sober, solitary, and full
    of notions. She loved dogs and horses, hunting and theatres
    passionately, and was never seen except in full dress or in a
    man&rsquo;s wig and riding-habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He concludes his portrait admirably in these words:
    &ldquo;The figure and rusticity of a Swiss, but capable withal of
    a tender and inviolable friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Introduced at Court by her aunt, the illustrious Princess
    Palatine, Anne of Gonzaga, in nothing was she in keeping
    with it,&mdash;neither in spirit, nor in the gifts of insinuation and
    conciliatory conduct, nor in caution. Succeeding the first
    Madame, she seemed even farther aloof from it, more
    completely a contrast in manners, in the quality and
    turn of her thoughts, in delicacy, in short, in everything.
    Madame, throughout her life, was, and must necessarily
    have been, the contrary of many things and many persons
    about her; she was original, at any rate, and in all ways
    Herself.</p>
<p>It seems an irony of fate that gave as second wife to
    Monsieur, that prince so weak and so effeminate, a woman who
    in tastes was far more like a man, and who always regretted
    she was not born a boy. Madame gayly relates how, in her
    youth, feeling her vocation as a cavalier very strongly, she
    was always expecting some miracle of Nature in her favour.
    With this idea she devoted herself as much as she could to
    all manly exercises and perilous leaping. She cared much
    more for swords and guns than for dolls. But above all
    she proves how little of a woman&rsquo;s nature was in her by
    the want of delicacy, or, to speak plainly, the lack of modesty
    in what she says. She is honesty itself, virtue, fidelity,
    honour; but also, at times, indecency and coarseness personified.
    She speaks of everything indiscriminately, like
    a man, is never disgusted by any language, and never goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> by four roads when she has to express something which
    would be difficult and embarrassing to any one but herself.
    Contrary to the nature of women, she has no desire to please,
    and no coquetry. Being asked one day why she never
    glanced into a mirror in passing it, &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she replied,
    &ldquo;I have too much self-love to like to see how ugly I am.&rdquo;
    The fine portrait by Rigaud gives us a perfect likeness of
    her in her old age, portly, fat, a double chin and red cheeks,
    with dignity of carriage nevertheless, and a proud bearing, but
    an expression of kindness in the eyes and smile.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> She herself
    was pleased at times to record her ugliness; one might
    even suppose that she valued it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no matter whether one is handsome or not; a fine
    face changes soon, but a good conscience is always good. You
    must remember very little of me if you do not rank me
    among the ugly ones; I have always been so, and I am more
    so now because of the small-pox. My waist is monstrous in
    size; I am as square as a cube; my skin is red, mottled with
    yellow; my hair is getting gray; my nose is honeycombed
    with the small-pox, and so are my cheeks; I have a large
    mouth and bad teeth; and there&rsquo;s the portrait of my pretty
    face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly no one was ever ugly with more spirit and light-heartedness.
    Occasionally there slips in beneath Madame&rsquo;s
    pen and her expressions a natural vein of Rabelais and the
    grotesque. She fills in that way a unique corner in the
    Court of Louis XIV. Knowing well what was due to her
    rank and never departing from it, there are many occasions
    when she is incongruous with it and violates decorum.</p>
<p>It was perhaps by this naïve brusqueness, and also by her
    solid qualities as an honest woman (I was going to say an
    honest man), that she pleased Louis XIV., so that between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> herself and him there was formed a friendship which was
    not without its singularity, and which at first sight seems
    surprising. Mme. de Sévigné, in a letter to her daughter,
    seems to think that Madame felt for Louis XIV. (as the preceding
    Madame had done) an inclination that was more or
    less romantic, and which affected her without her admitting
    to herself exactly what it was. There is a little too much
    that is far-fetched in all this. In general, as I have already
    remarked, Mme. de Sévigné understands Madame very little,
    and does not give herself the trouble to seek the meaning of
    a nature so little French. When she hears that the princess
    fainted with grief at the sudden news of the death of her
    father, the Elector Palatine, Mme. de Sévigné jests about it
    thus: &ldquo;On this, Madame began to cry and weep and make a
    strange noise; they said she fainted, but I do not believe
    it; she seems to me incapable of that sign of weakness.
    All that death could do would be to sober her spirits,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>fixer
    ses esprits</i>, because <i>ses esprits</i> (in the language of the
    physics of the day) were always in movement and great
    agitation.</p>
<p>But let us leave for a moment such French pleasantry and
    this facility for trifling with everything and over-refining all
    things. Madame, married in so sad and hapless a manner,
    and with whom one had only to talk, it was said, to be disgusted
    at once with the painful conditions of marriage,&mdash;Madame
    was not the woman to fall back upon romance to
    console her for reality. Thrown into the midst of a brilliant
    but false Court, full at that time of gallantry and pleasures
    which merely covered ambitions and rivalries, she distinguished
    with an instinct of good sense and a certain pride of
    race the person to whom she could attach herself in the
    midst of all these people, and she turned with her natural
    uprightness to the most honest man among them, namely, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> Louis XIV. himself. A Jesuit, who pronounced a funeral
    oration over Madame, Père Cathalan, has said on this subject
    all that was best to say. In the kingdom at that time
    was a king who was worthy of being one; with the good
    qualities we know well, combined with defects which every
    one about him sought to favour and encourage; a king who
    was essentially a man of merit, &ldquo;always master and always
    king, but more of an honest man and Christian than he was
    master or king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this merit that touched her,&rdquo; says Père Cathalan,
    very truly. &ldquo;A taste for, and, if I may so express myself,
    a sympathy of greatness attached Madame to Louis XIV.
    Inward affinities make noble attachments of esteem and
    respect; and great souls, though the features of their greatness
    may differ, feel, and resemble one another. She esteemed,
    she honoured, shall I venture to say she loved that
    great king because she was great herself. She loved him
    when he was greater than his fortunes; she loved him still
    more when he was greater than his sorrows. We saw her
    giving to the dying monarch her bitter tears, giving them
    again to his memory, seeking him in that superb palace so
    filled with his presence and his virtues, saying often how she
    missed him, and feeling always the wound of his death,&mdash;a
    sentiment which the glory of her son, the regent, could never
    take away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame was agreeable to Louis XIV. by her frankness,
    her open nature; she amused him with her repartees and her
    lively talk; she made him laugh with all his heart, for (a
    rare thing at Courts) she liked joy for joy&rsquo;s sake. &ldquo;Joy is
    very good for the health,&rdquo; thought she; &ldquo;the silliest thing is
    to be sad.&rdquo; She broke the monotony of Court ceremony,
    the long silent meals, the slow minuets of all kinds. What
    would have been incongruous in others had a certain spice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> in her; she had her privileges. &ldquo;When the king dislikes to
    say a thing directly to any one, he addresses his speech
    to me; he knows very well that I don&rsquo;t constrain myself
    in conversation, and that diverts him. At table he
    is obliged to talk with me because nobody else will say a
    word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not so inferior to the king as might be thought;
    or rather she was not inferior to him at all except in
    politeness, in moderation, in the spirit of consistency and
    sobriety. In certain respects she judged him with much
    intelligence, and with freer and broader good sense than he
    was capable of himself; she thought him ignorant in many
    ways, and she was right. What she valued most in him
    was his uprightness of feeling, and the accuracy of his <i>coup-d&rsquo;&#339;il</i> when left to himself; also the quality of his mind, the
    charm of his intercourse, the excellent expression of his
    thoughts,&mdash;it was, in short, a certain loftiness of nature which
    attracted and charmed her in Louis XIV. She aided more
    than any other in consoling him and diverting his mind after
    the death of the Duchesse de Bourgogne; she went to him
    every evening at the permitted hour, and she saw that he
    was pleased with her company. &ldquo;There is no one but Madame
    who does not leave me now,&rdquo; said Louis XIV. &ldquo;I see
    that she is glad to be with me.&rdquo; Madame has ingenuously
    expressed the sort of open and sincere affection that she felt
    for Louis XIV. by saying: &ldquo;If the king had been my father
    I could not have loved him more than I did love him, and I
    had pleasure in being with him.&rdquo; When the king&rsquo;s health
    declined and he neared his last hour, we find Madame laying
    bare her grief in her letters; she, whose son was about to
    become regent, she dreads more than any one the change of
    reign. &ldquo;The king is not well,&rdquo; she says, August 15, 1715,
    &ldquo;and it troubles me to the point of being half ill myself; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> have lost both sleep and appetite. God grant I may be
    mistaken! but if what I fear should happen it would be for
    me the greatest of misfortunes.&rdquo; She relates the last scenes
    of farewell with true and visible emotion. The little good
    that has been done in the final years of that long reign she
    attributes to Louis XIV.; and all that was bad she imputes
    to her whom she considers an evil genius and the devil personified,&mdash;to
    Mme. de Maintenon.</p>
<p>And here we come to Madame&rsquo;s great antipathy, to what
    in her is almost unimaginable prejudice, hatred, and animosity
    so violent that they become at times comical. And
    truly, if Madame at a given moment had really been in love
    with Louis XIV., and if she had hated in Mme. de Maintenon
    the rival who supplanted her, she could not have expressed
    herself otherwise. But there is no need of that sort
    of explanation for a nature so easy to prejudice, so difficult
    to placate, and so wholly in opposition and contrast to the
    point of departure and proceedings of Mme. de Maintenon.
    Hers were antipathies of race, of condition, of temperament,
    which long years passed in the presence, the continual sight,
    the rigid restraint of their object only cultivated, secretly
    fomented, and exasperated. Who has not seen such long-suppressed
    enmities which explode when an opening is made
    for them?</p>
<p>Madame, pre-eminently princess of a sovereign house, who
    never, with all her natural human qualities and her free and
    easy ways, forgot the duties of birth and grandeur, she of
    whom it was said, &ldquo;No great personage ever knew her rights
    better or made them better felt by others,&rdquo;&mdash;Madame held
    nothing in so much horror and contempt as misalliances.
    The gallery at Versailles long echoed with the resounding
    blow she applied to her son on the day when, having consented
    to marry the natural daughter of Louis XIV., he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> approached his mother according to custom, to kiss her hand.
    Now of all misalliances what could be greater or more inexcusable
    to her eyes than that which placed Mme. de Maintenon
    beside Louis XIV.?</p>
<p>Madame, natural, frank, letting her feelings willingly escape
    her, liking to pour them out, often in excess beyond themselves
    and observing no caution, could not away with the
    cold procedure, prudent, cautious, mysterious, polite, and
    unassailable, of a person to whom she attributed a thousand
    schemes blacker and deeper than those of hell.</p>
<p>She disliked her for little things and disliked her for
    great ones. She supposed that it was Mme. de Maintenon
    who, in concert with Père de La Chaise, had plotted and
    carried through the persecution of the Reformers; in this
    she was not only human, but she found herself once more a
    little of a Calvinist or a Lutheran with a touch of the old
    leaven; she thought close at hand what the refugees in
    Holland were writing from afar. She believed she saw in
    Mme. de Maintenon a Tartuffe in a sage-coloured gown.
    And besides&mdash;another grievance almost as serious!&mdash;if there
    was no longer any etiquette at Court, if ranks were no longer
    preserved and defined, Mme. de Maintenon was the cause
    of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no longer a Court in France,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;and
    it is the fault of the Maintenon, who, finding that the king
    would not declare her queen, was determined there should
    be no more great functions, and has persuaded the young
    dauphine [the Duchesse de Bourgogne] to stay in her, Mme.
    de Maintenon&rsquo;s rooms, where there is no distinction of rank
    or dignity. Under pretext of its being a game, the old
    woman has induced the dauphine and the princesses to wait
    upon her at her toilet and meals; she has even persuaded
    them to hand her the dishes, change her plates, and pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> what she drank. Everything is topsy-turvy, and none of
    them know their right place nor what they are. I have
    never mixed myself up in all that: when I go to see the
    lady I place myself close to her niche in an armchair, and
    I never help her either at her meals or her toilet. Some
    persons have advised me to do as the dauphine and the
    princesses do, but I answer: &lsquo;I was never brought up to
    do servile things, and I am too old to play childish games.&rsquo;
    Since then no one has said anything more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should never end if I enumerated all the reasons by
    which Madame brought herself, gradually and insensibly, to
    a species of mania which seizes her whenever she has to
    speak of Mme. de Maintenon, for there are no terms that she
    does not employ about her. On this subject she drops into
    whatever the grossest popular credulity could imagine in its
    days of madness; she sees in Mme. de Maintenon, even
    after the death of Louis XIV. and while buried at Saint-Cyr,
    a monopolist of wheat, a poisoner expert in the art of
    a Brinvilliers, a Gorgon, an incendiary who sets fire to the
    château de Lunéville. And after she has exhausted everything,
    she adds: &ldquo;All the evil that has been said of this
    diabolical woman is still below the truth.&rdquo; She applies to
    her an old German proverb: &ldquo;Where the devil can&rsquo;t go
    himself he sends an old woman.&rdquo; Saint-Simon, inflamed
    as he is, pales beside this fabulous hatred, and has himself
    told us the secret of it.</p>
<p>One day, on a memorable occasion, Madame found herself
    humiliated before Mme. de Maintenon, forced to admit
    a wrong she had done her, to make her excuses before
    witnesses, and to say she was gratefully obliged to her.
    This happened on the death of Monsieur (June, 1701).
    Madame, who at that serious crisis had everything to
    obtain from the king both for herself and for her son (and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> did in fact obtain it), made the effort to lay her dignity
    aside and address herself to Mme. de Maintenon. The latter
    went to see her, and in presence of the Duchesse de Ventadour
    as witness, she represented to Madame, after listening
    to her, that the king had much reason to complain of her,
    but was willing to overlook it all. Madame, believing herself
    quite safe, protested her innocence; Mme. de Maintenon,
    with great self-possession, allowed her to speak to the
    end, and then drew from her pocket a letter, such as
    Madame wrote daily to her aunt the Electress of Hanover,
    in which she spoke in the most outrageous terms of the
    relations between the king and Mme. de Maintenon. We
    can imagine that Madame, at the sight, nearly died upon
    the spot.</p>
<p>When the name of the king was laid aside Mme. de
    Maintenon began to speak on her own account, and to
    answer Madame&rsquo;s reproaches for having changed in her
    sentiments towards her. After allowing Madame, as before,
    to say all that she had to say and to commit herself
    to a certain extent, she suddenly quoted to her certain
    secret words particularly offensive to herself, which she
    had known and kept on her heart for ten years,&mdash;words
    that were said by Madame to a princess, then dead, who
    had repeated them, word for word, to Mme. de Maintenon.
    At the fall of this second thunderbolt Madame was turned
    into a statue, and there was silence for some moments.
    Then followed tears, cries, pardon, promises, and a reconciliation,
    which, being founded on the cold triumph of
    Mme. de Maintenon and the inward humiliation of Madame,
    could not of course last long.</p>
<p>It was soon after this scene and during the very short
    time that the renewed friendship lasted that Madame wrote
    to Mme. de Maintenon the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p class="sig"><span class="blockquot"> Wednesday, June 15, 11 in the morning. </span></p>
<p class="blockquot">If I had not had fever and great agitation, Madame, from
    the sad employment of yesterday, in opening the caskets
    containing Monsieur&rsquo;s papers, scented with the most violent
    perfumes, you would have heard from me earlier; but I
    can no longer delay expressing to you how touched I am
    by the favours that the king did yesterday to my son, and
    the manner in which he has treated both him and myself;
    and as all this is the result of your good counsels, Madame,
    be pleased to allow me to express my sense of it, and to
    assure you that I shall keep, very inviolably, the promise
    of friendship which I made to you; I beg you to continue
    to me your counsels and advice, and not to doubt a gratitude
    that can end only with my life.</p>
<p class="sig"><span class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Élisabeth Charlotte.</span></span></p>
<p>Proud as Madame was, there was nothing for her, after such
    a step and such a reconciliation so painful to the core, but to
    become henceforth the intimate and cordial friend of Mme.
    de Maintenon, or her implacable enemy. The latter sentiment
    prevailed. In spite of efforts which may have been
    for a time sincere, the conditions and the repugnances were
    too strong; antipathies rose up once more and carried all
    before them.</p>
<p>Madame deserves consideration by more than one claim,
    and especially because, having written much, her testimony
    stands and is invoked in many cases. When the present
    edition of letters and fragments of letters by M. Brunet is
    exhausted, why should he not undertake to form a complete
    collection, leaving nothing out that could enrich and enlighten
    it on the German side, and adding only such notes
    and French erudition as may be strictly necessary? We
    should then have, not exactly an historical document added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> to so many others, but a great chronicle of manners and
    morals, a fiery social gossip, by one whom we may call the
    Gui Patin or the Tallemant des Reaux of the end of the
    seventeenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth.
    We should thus gain a vivid, witty, and ruthless book,
    which would make a pendant to Saint-Simon on more than
    one ground.</p>
<p>Madame and Saint-Simon have this in common&mdash;they
    were two honest souls at Court, honest souls whom indignation
    easily roused; often passionate, prejudiced, and at such
    times ferocious and pitiless for the adversary. Saint-Simon&mdash;need
    it be said?&mdash;has over Madame all the superiority of
    a genius expressly made to sound and fathom hearts, and to
    bring back living descriptions, which he gives us in strokes
    of flame. Madame, often credulous, looking elsewhere, mixing
    things up and little critical in her judgments, nevertheless
    sees well what she does see, and renders it forcibly, with
    a violence which, though little conformed to French taste, is
    none the less imprinted on the memory. They knew each
    other and esteemed each other. They had, without suspecting
    it, the same idiosyncrasies, which they observed, reciprocally,
    in each other; one was astride of her rank as princess
    and ever on the <i>qui-vive</i> lest it should not be sufficiently
    respected; the other, as we know, was intractable and even
    fanatical on the chapter of dukes and peers.</p>
<p>Saint-Simon has spoken of Madame with truth and justice,
    as of a manly nature somewhat in keeping with his own.
    All that we read in Madame&rsquo;s letters, in which she declares
    herself to every eye, is only a sort of demonstration and commentary
    of Saint-Simon&rsquo;s judgment upon her.</p>
<p>Madame was naturally just, humane, compassionate. She
    was very anxious about her debts and her creditors, which
    the great of the earth are not apt to be, and it was noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> that she was never easy unless she had secured their payment,&mdash;&ldquo;forestalling
    demands, sometimes wishes, and always
    impatience or complaints.&rdquo; The letters she writes during
    the terrible winter of 1709 breathe pity for the poor, who
    &ldquo;are dying of cold like flies.&rdquo; No princess ever had more
    consideration for those who surrounded her and served her;
    &ldquo;she preferred sometimes to deprive herself of necessary
    attentions, rather than require them when inconvenient to
    others.&rdquo; She was what is called a good mistress, and the
    nearer her people came to her, the more they regretted her.
    &ldquo;Saint-Cloud,&rdquo; she wrote in the autumn of 1717, &ldquo;is only a
    house for summer; many of my people have to lodge in
    rooms without fireplaces; they cannot pass the winter here,
    or I should be the cause of their deaths, and I am not
    hard enough for that; the sufferings of others make me
    pitiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once only was she pitiless; but she was wounded then in
    her tenderest spot. Mme. de Maintenon had imported from
    Strasburg (<i>expressly to annoy me</i>, thought Madame) two
    girls of equivocal birth who called themselves Comtesses
    Palatine and whom she placed in the suite of her nieces.
    The first dauphine (Monseigneur&rsquo;s wife, a Princess of
    Bavaria) spoke of this to Madame, weeping, but not daring
    to resent an affront which was aimed at both. &ldquo;Let me
    settle that,&rdquo; replied Madame. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage it; for when I
    am right nothing frightens me.&rdquo; The next day she arranged
    an accidental meeting in the park with one of the two self-styled
    Comtesses Palatine, and treated her in such a manner
    (the astounding terms have been preserved) that the poor girl
    was taken ill, and finally died of it. Louis XIV. contented
    himself with saying to Madame, &ldquo;It is not safe to meddle
    with you in the matter of your family&mdash;life depends upon
    it.&rdquo; To which Madame replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like impostors.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> And she never felt the slightest regret for what she had
    done. The trait is characteristic in a nature that was otherwise
    essentially kind. All vehement passion easily becomes
    cruel when face to face with an object that irritates and
    braves it. In this case the execution performed by Madame
    appeared to her under the form of a rigorous duty of honour.</p>
<p>The life that Madame led at the Court of France varied,
    necessarily, during the fifty and one years that she spent
    there; she could not live at the age of sixty as she had done
    at twenty. But at all times, before and after the death of
    Monsieur, she had managed to make for herself a retreat and
    a sort of solitude. The exaggerated and incongruous sides of
    Madame&rsquo;s nature being now sufficiently visible and well
    known, I desire to neglect nothing that will show the firm
    and elevated parts of her soul. From Saint-Cloud June 17,
    1698, she writes thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not need much consolation in the matter of death;
    I do not desire death, neither do I dread it. There is no
    need of the Catechism of Heidelberg to teach us not to be
    attached to this world; above all in this country where all
    things are so full of falseness, envy, and malignity, where
    the most unheard-of vices are displayed without reserve. But
    to desire death is a thing entirely against nature. In the
    midst of this great Court I live retired, as if in solitude;
    there are very few persons with whom I have frequent intercourse;
    I am whole, long days alone in my cabinet, where
    I busy myself in reading and writing. If any one pays me
    a visit I see them for only a few moments; I talk of rain
    and fine weather or the news of the day; and after that I
    take refuge in my retreat. Four times a week I send off
    my regular letters: Monday, to Savoie; Wednesday, to
    Modena; Thursday and Sunday I write very long letters to
    my aunt in Hanover; from six to eight o&rsquo;clock I drive out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> with Monsieur and my ladies; three times a week I go to
    Paris, and every day I write to my friends who live there; I
    hunt twice a week; and this is how I pass my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she speaks of solitude we see it is a Court solitude
    and much diversified. Still it was remarkable that a woman
    of so grand a station and a princess should spend so many
    hours daily alone in her cabinet in company with her desk.</p>
<p>After the death of Monsieur, Madame could live more to
    her liking. She regretted being obliged to dismiss her maids-of-honour,
    whose youth and gayety amused her; but she
    gave herself a compensation after her own heart, by taking
    to herself, without official title, two friends, the Maréchale
    de Clérembault and the Comtesse de Beuvron, both widows,
    whom Monsieur had dismissed with aversion from the
    Court of the Palais-Royal, but to whom Madame had ever
    remained faithful in absence. They were the &ldquo;friends in
    Paris,&rdquo; to whom she wrote continually. Becoming free herself,
    she wanted them near her, and henceforth enjoyed,
    almost as a simple private person, that united constant
    friendship in which she trusted.</p>
<p>Hunting was long one of Madame&rsquo;s greatest pleasures, or
    rather passions. I have said that while a child at Heidelberg
    she gave herself up to all manly exercises. Her father,
    however, forbade her to hunt or to ride on horseback. It
    was in France, therefore, that she served her apprenticeship,
    and her impetuosity often made it dangerous. Twenty-six
    times was she thrown from her horse, without being frightened
    or discouraged. &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;that you
    have never seen a great hunt? I have seen more than a
    thousand stags taken, and I have had bad falls; but out of
    twenty-six times that I have been thrown from my horse I
    never hurt myself but once, and then I dislocated my
    elbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>The theatre was another passion, which, in her, was derived
    from intelligence and her natural taste for things of
    the understanding. It was the only pleasure (except that of
    writing letters) which lasted to the end of her life. She was
    not of the opinion of Bossuet, Bourdaloue, and other great
    religious oracles of the day in the matter of theatres; she
    forestalled the opinion of the future and that of the most
    indulgent moralists. &ldquo;With regard to the priests who
    forbid the theatre,&rdquo; she says, rather irreverently, &ldquo;I shall say
    no more, except this, that if they saw a little further than
    their own noses they would understand that the money
    people spend on going to the play is not ill-spent; in the
    first place, the comedians are poor devils who earn their
    living that way; and next, comedies inspire joy, joy produces
    health, health gives strength, strength produces good work;
    therefore comedies should be encouraged, and not forbidden.&rdquo;
    She liked to laugh, and the &ldquo;Malade Imaginaire&rdquo; diverted
    her to such a degree that one might think in reading her
    letters that she was trying to imitate all that is most physical
    and unfit for women in its style of pleasantry. And yet
    &ldquo;the &lsquo;Malade Imaginaire&rsquo; is not the one of Molière&rsquo;s plays
    that I like best,&rdquo; she says; &ldquo;Tartuffe pleases me better.&rdquo;
    And in another letter: &ldquo;I cannot write longer, for I am
    called to go to the theatre; I am to see the &lsquo;Misanthrope,&rsquo;
    the one of Molière&rsquo;s plays that gives me the most pleasure.&rdquo;
    She admired Corneille and quotes the &ldquo;Death of
    Pompey.&rdquo; I do not know whether she liked &ldquo;Esther,&rdquo; but
    she must surely have loved Shakespeare. &ldquo;I have often
    heard his Highness, our father,&rdquo; she writes to her half-sister,
    &ldquo;say that there are no comedies in the world finer than those
    of the English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the death of Monsieur and during the last years
    of Louis XIV. she adopted a way of life that was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> precise and retired. &ldquo;I live here quite deserted (May 3,
    1709) for everybody, young and old, runs after favour. The
    Maintenon cannot endure me, and the Duchesse de Bourgogne
    likes only what that lady likes.&rdquo; She became at last absolutely
    a hermit in the midst of the Court. &ldquo;I consort with
    no one here, except my own people; I am as polite as I can
    be to everybody, but I contract no intimate relations with
    any one, and I live alone; I go to walk, I go to drive, but
    from two o&rsquo;clock to half-past nine I never see a human
    face; I read, I write, or I amuse myself in making baskets
    like the one I sent my aunt.&rdquo; Sometimes, however, to enliven
    this long interval from two o&rsquo;clock to half-past nine,
    her ladies would play at <i>hombre</i> or <i>brelan</i> beside her writing-table.</p>
<p>The regency of her son brought the Court again around
    Madame; and her more frequent residence in Paris allowed
    her less retreat than she was able to make at Versailles.
    Sometimes, in the morning, half a dozen duchesses would
    take up her time and cut short her correspondence. She
    detested their conversations of mere politeness, in which
    they talked without having anything to say. &ldquo;I would
    rather be alone than have to give myself the trouble of
    finding something to say to each of them; for the French
    think it very bad if you do not talk to them, and go away
    discontented; one must therefore take pains to say something
    to each; and so I am content and tranquil when they
    leave me to myself.&rdquo; She made exception with less annoyance
    when it was a question of Germans of high rank, who
    all wished to be presented to her, and whom she greeted
    very well. At times there were as many as twenty-nine
    German princes, counts, and gentlemen in her apartment.</p>
<p>One evening she made a scene before all present to the
    Duchesse de Berry, her grand-daughter, who had appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> before her in a loose gown, or rather in fancy dress, intending
    to go to the Tuileries in such array. &ldquo;No, madame,&rdquo; she
    said, cutting short all explanation, &ldquo;nothing excuses you;
    you might at least dress yourself properly the few times you
    do go to see the king; I, who am your grandmother, dress
    myself every day. Say honestly it is laziness that prevents
    you from doing so; which belongs neither to your age nor
    to your station. A princess should be dressed as a princess,
    and a soubrette as a soubrette.&rdquo; While saying all this and
    not listening to the reply of the Duchesse de Berry, Madame
    went on writing her letter in German, her pen never ceasing
    to scratch the paper. The table on which she wrote was a
    secretary somewhat raised, so that in her pausing moments
    she could, without rising from her seat, look down upon the
    game of the players beside her. &ldquo;That was her occupation
    if she ceased to write, but when any one came in and approached
    her she would leave everything to ask them, &lsquo;What
    news?&rsquo; and as the giving of news made every one welcome,
    people invented it when there was none to tell. No sooner
    had she heard it than, without examination, she turned to
    the letter already begun and wrote down the tale she had
    just been told.&rdquo; It is thus that, side by side with things
    that she sees well and says well, and which are in truth the
    expression of her own thought, her letters contain much else
    that is simply malignant gossip and trash.</p>
<p>In the days of Louis XIV. letters were unsealed at the
    post-office, read, and extracts made and sent to the king, and
    sometimes to Mme. de Maintenon. Madame knew that, but
    went her way in spite of it, using her privilege as princess
    to tell truths without reserve, and even to write insults on
    those who, unsealing the letters, would find her opinion of
    them. &ldquo;In the days of M. de Louvois,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;they
    read all letters just as they do now, but at least they sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> them on in decent time; but now that that toad of a Torcy
    directs the post-office, letters are delayed for an interminable
    length of time.... As Torcy does not know how to read
    German he has to have them translated, and I don&rsquo;t thank
    him for his attention.&rdquo; M. de Torcy must have enjoyed
    that passage.</p>
<p>Among the tastes, or fancies, which together with her
    letter-writing served to fill and amuse the long hours of Madame&rsquo;s
    solitude, we must reckon two parrots, a canary, and
    eight little dogs. &ldquo;After my dinner I walk my room for half
    an hour for the sake of digestion, and play with my little
    animals.&rdquo; A nobler taste was that of coins, which Madame
    had to a high degree. She collected them from all parts of
    the world, and no one could pay their court more delicately
    than by bringing her a specimen. The collection that she
    thus formed was celebrated. She confided the care of it to
    the learned Baudelot, who had all the erudition and naïveté
    of an antiquary, and with whom she sometimes amused herself.
    &ldquo;One study alone,&rdquo; says one of her eulogists, &ldquo;attracted
    her&mdash;that of coins. Her series of the emperors of the
    upper and lower empire, which she collected with judgment
    and arranged with care, placed before her eyes all that was
    most to be respected in past ages. While examining the
    features on the coins she recalled the salient points of their
    owners&rsquo; actions, filling her mind with noble ideas of Roman
    greatness.&rdquo; I do not know whether in forming her cabinet
    of coins Madame had any such lofty and stern views, but at
    any rate, in this most remarkable of her tastes she showed
    herself the mother of the regent,&mdash;that is to say, of the most
    brilliant and best-informed of amateurs.</p>
<p>There is a serious side in the letters of Madame: that by
    which she judges the morals, the personages, and the society
    of the regency. She had some trouble in breaking herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> in to that new style of life, and to a residence in the city and
    the Palais-Royal. &ldquo;I like the Parisians,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;but I
    do not like to live in their town.&rdquo; She had accustomed herself,
    during her long seasons at Saint-Cloud, to a measure of
    retreat, companionship, and liberty which suited her nature,
    and I shall even say, her semi-philosophy. When she returned
    there she felt herself in her element. &ldquo;I find myself
    well at Saint-Cloud, where I am tranquil (1718); whereas in
    Paris I am never left an instant in peace. This one presents
    me a petition, that one asks me to interest myself on his
    behalf, another solicits an audience, and so forth. In this
    world great people have their worries like little ones, which
    is not surprising; but what makes it worse for the great is
    that they are always surrounded by a crowd, so that they
    can not hide their griefs, or indulge them in solitude&mdash;they
    are always on exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That regret was in her a most sincere one. The power of
    her son brought her little influence, and she wanted none,
    save for the sake of a few private benefits. She asked him
    for nothing; she never meddled in public affairs or politics,
    and piqued herself on not understanding them. &ldquo;I have no
    ambition,&rdquo; she said (August, 1719); &ldquo;I do not wish to govern;
    I should take no pleasure in it. It is not so with French
    women; the lowest servant-woman thinks herself quite
    fitted to rule the State. I think it so ridiculous that I am
    quite cured of all mania of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She views like a virtuous woman the debauchery of the
    period, and that of her family, and she expresses the deep
    disgust she feels for it. The regent has never been better
    painted than he is by his mother; she shows him to us with
    his facile faculties, his interests of all kinds, his talents, his
    individual genius, his graces, his indulgence for all, even for
    his enemies; she denounces the one great capital fault that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> ruined him,&mdash;that ardent debauchery at a fixed hour, in
    which he buried himself and was lost to sight until the next
    morning. &ldquo;All advice, all remonstrance on that subject,&rdquo;
    she writes, &ldquo;are useless; when spoken to he answers, &lsquo;From
    six o&rsquo;clock in the morning till night I am subjected to prolonged
    and fatiguing labour; if I did not amuse myself after
    that I could not bear it, I should die of melancholy.&rsquo; I pray
    God sincerely for his conversion,&rdquo; she adds, &ldquo;he has no
    other fault than that, but that is great.&rdquo; She shows him to
    us as a libertine even in matters of science, that is, curious
    and amorous of all he saw, but disgusted with all he possessed.
    &ldquo;Though he talks of learned things, I see plainly
    that instead of giving him pleasure they bore him. I have
    often scolded him for this; he answers it is not his fault;
    that he does take pleasure in learning all things, but as
    soon as he knows them he has no further pleasure in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most characteristic passages in her letters are of things
    that cannot be detached and cited singly. Never did the
    effrontery and gluttony of women of all ranks, the cupidity
    of everybody, the shameless traffic and cynical thirst for
    gold, find a firmer or more vigorous hand to catch them
    in the act and blast them. Madame, in treating of these
    excesses, has a species of virtuous immodesty like that of
    Juvenal; or rather, issuing from her Bible readings, she
    applies to present scandals the energy of the sacred text,
    and qualifies them in the language of the patriarchs. &ldquo;How
    many times,&rdquo; says one of her eulogists whom I like to quote,
    &ldquo;how many times she condemned the bold negligence of
    attire which favoured corruption, and the taste for liberty
    and caprice&mdash;the fatal charm which our nation has criminally
    invented! Indecent fashions, which ancient decorum
    cannot away with, would often bring upon her face and in
    her eyes the emotion and fire of outraged modesty.&rdquo; It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> not a mere sentiment of etiquette which made her rebuke
    her grand-daughter, the Duchesse de Berry, on her dishabille,
    but another and a more estimable sentiment. Even where she
    is not outraged she gives details which make her smile with
    pity. &ldquo;It is only too true that the women paint themselves
    blue veins to make believe their skins are so delicate the
    veins show through them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duc de Richelieu, a young dandy who turned all the
    heads of the day, and whom our writers, at their wits&rsquo; end,
    have lately endeavoured to restore to fashion in novels and
    plays, was to Madame an object of extreme aversion; she
    paints him with the hand of a master, as absolutely contemptible,
    with all his equivocal and frivolous charms, his varnish
    of politeness, and his vices. It is a portrait to read, and I
    should like to quote it here, but I am restrained by respect
    for the great men, and for the honourable men, who have
    made that name of Richelieu so French. Without going beyond
    general observations what can be more just and more
    sensible than the following reflection of Madame, written a few
    months before her death (April, 1722)? &ldquo;Young men, at the
    epoch in which we live, have but two objects in view,&mdash;debauchery
    and lucre; the absorption of their minds on money-getting,
    no matter by what means, makes them dull and
    disagreeable; in order to be agreeable, people must have
    their minds free of care, and also have the wish to give
    themselves up to amusement in decent company; but these
    are things that are very far away from us now-a-days.&rdquo;
    With a presentiment of her coming end, she asks of God
    only his mercy to herself and her children, especially her
    son. &ldquo;May it please God to convert him! that is the
    sole favour that I ask of Him. I do not believe that
    there are in Paris, either among ecclesiastics or people of
    the world, one hundred persons who have a true Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> faith, and really believe in our Saviour; and that makes
    me tremble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people of Paris recognized in Madame a princess of
    honour and integrity, incapable of giving bad advice or
    employing selfish influence; consequently, she was in great
    favour with the Parisians; more than she deserved, she said,
    meddling so little as she did in their affairs. Even amid
    the riots and the execrations roused by the catastrophes
    at the close of Law&rsquo;s system, Madame, as she drove through
    the streets, received none but benedictions&mdash;which she
    would gladly have transferred to her son. She noticed as
    a mother on that occasion that if the cries were loud against
    Law, they were at least not shouted against the regent. But
    there were other days when the murmurs against her son
    reached her ears, and she complains of the ingratitude of
    Frenchmen towards him. She was not, however, without
    admitting to herself the element of weakness in his government;
    she tells it and repeats it constantly. &ldquo;It is very
    true,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;that it is better to be kind than harsh, but
    justice consists in punishing, as well as in rewarding; and
    it is certain that he who does not make Frenchmen fear
    him will soon fear them; for they despise those who do
    not intimidate them.&rdquo; She knows the nation, and judges
    it as one who is not of it.</p>
<p>On one point Madame sacrificed to the spirit of the
    regency and was in curious contradiction to herself. She
    took a great liking to a natural son of the regent, whom he
    had by an opera-dancer named Florence; she said he reminded
    her of the &ldquo;late Monsieur,&rdquo; only with a better figure.
    In short, she loved the young man, whom she called <i>her</i> Abbé de Saint-Albin. He was afterwards Archbishop of
    Cambrai, and when he made his argument before the
    Sorbonne (February, 1718) she was present in great state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> thus declaring, and also honouring, the illegitimate birth of
    this grandson. Madame deserted on that day all her orthodox
    principles about the duties of rank, and allowed herself
    to follow her fancies.</p>
<p>She died at the age of seventy at Saint-Cloud, December
    8, 1722, ten days after her faithful friend, the Maréchale
    de Clérembault, and one year before her son, the regent.
    According to her own wish, she was taken to Saint-Denis
    without pomp. The obsequies were performed in the following
    February. Massillon, whom she knew and loved,
    pronounced her funeral oration, which was thought fine.
    Père Cathalan, a Jesuit, pronounced another at Laon in
    March, from which I have taken certain traits of her
    character.</p>
<p>Such as she is, with all her coarseness and her contradictions
    on a basis of virtue and honour, Madame is a useful,
    a precious, and an incomparable witness as to manners and
    morals. She gives a hand to Saint-Simon and to Dangeau&mdash;nearer,
    however, to the former than to the latter. She
    has heart; do not ask charm of her, but say: &ldquo;That Court
    would have lacked the most original of figures and of voices
    if Madame had not been of it.&rdquo; Arriving at Versailles at
    the moment when the La Vallière star declined and was
    eclipsed, and seeing only the last of the brilliant years,
    she enters little into that era of refinement which touches
    the imagination; but lacking that refinement, and solely
    through her frankness, she lays bare to us the second half
    of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s reign under its human, most human, natural,
    and&mdash;to say the whole truth&mdash;its material aspect. She
    strips that great century of its idealism, she strips it too
    much; she goes almost to the point of degrading it&mdash;if
    we listen to her alone. As time goes on, and the delicacy
    and purity of manners and language retire more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> into Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s corner and seek at last a refuge
    at Saint-Cyr, Madame holds herself aloof at Saint-Cloud,
    and again aloof in the Palais-Royal, and thence&mdash;whether
    at the close of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s reign or under the regency&mdash;she
    makes, lance in hand, and her pen behind her ear,
    valiant and frequent sorties in that blunt style which
    is all her own, which wears a beard upon its chin, and
    of which we know not rightly whether it derives from
    Luther or from Rabelais, though we are very sure it is the
    opposite of that of Mme. de Caylus and her like.</p>

<h2>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S NOTE.</h2>
<p>Sainte-Beuve, in his essay on Madame, suggested to the
    French editor of her letters that he should make a more
    complete collection of them. M. Brunet professes to have
    done so in the edition from which this translation is selected.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But when examined the additions prove very insignificant,
    and the arrangement, though apparently more chronological,
    interferes with the interest of the reader. Passages which
    seem to belong together are cut up into sentences and
    scattered singly over weeks and months; so that the point
    of Madame&rsquo;s racy representations is often weakened. In
    this translation parts of the letters of each year on a given
    topic are put together, so as to offer a better picture of
    Madame&rsquo;s thought; as for her nature, she gives that herself,
    and no one can better the portrait.</p>
<p>Nothing need be added to Sainte-Beuve&rsquo;s admirable essay
    beyond a brief account of Madame&rsquo;s parentage, family relations,
    and the history, such as it is, of her correspondence.</p>
<p>She was born at Heidelberg in 1652. Soon after her
    birth, her father, Charles-Louis, Elector Palatine, parted
    from his wife, Charlotte of Hesse-Cassel, and the little
    daughter, Élisabeth-Charlotte, was given to the care of her
    father&rsquo;s sister, Sophia, Electress of Hanover (mother of
    George I. of England); with whom she remained until her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> marriage, against her wishes, in 1671, to Monsieur, brother
    of Louis XIV., after the death of his first wife, Henrietta,
    daughter of Charles I. of England. The marriage was political,&mdash;Louis
    XIV. seeking to acquire rights in the Palatinate,
    and subsequently in Bavaria.</p>
<p>The father of Élisabeth-Charlotte, after parting from his
    wife, married morganatically Louise de Degenfeld, by whom
    he had five sons and three daughters,&mdash;these children being
    of course excluded from the succession. Madame, in her
    ill-assorted and personally mortifying marriage, of which
    she bravely strove to make the best, found all her comfort
    in writing letters, a very small portion of which have been
    preserved. All those addressed during her married life to
    her beloved aunt, the Electress of Hanover, have disappeared,
    probably destroyed by the judicious aunt herself,
    for Madame alludes to them as containing secrets she did
    not write to others. Among the many personages to whom
    she wrote habitually were: Duke Antoine Ulrich of Brunswick;
    her two unmarried half-sisters, Louise and Amélie,
    Countesses Palatine; her step-daughters, to whom she was
    warmly attached, Marie-Louise, wife of Charles II., King of
    Spain, and Anne-Marie, wife of Victor-Amadeus, Duke of
    Savoie and King of Sardinia and Sicily (the mother of
    Marie-Adélaïde, Duchesse de Bourgogne); and her own
    daughter, the Duchesse de Lorraine. Besides these, she had
    a number of correspondents on the other side of the Rhine,
    such as her cousins the Queen of Prussia and the Duchess
    of Modena; her old governess in Hanover; Leibnitz in
    Leipzig; also the Princess of Wales, Wilhelmina-Caroline of
    Brandebourg-Anspach, in London.</p>
<p>Of these letters (scarcely any remaining extant except
    those to her half-sisters) fragments first appeared at Stuttgard
    in 1789, subsequently in Paris, in 1807, 1823, 1832. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> 1843 the first edition in a volume was published at Stuttgard
    by M. Wolfgang Menzel, a translation of which by M.
    Brunet appeared in Paris in 1853. That translation was
    made from the German volume, the original letters having
    disappeared in a conflagration. A subsequent edition, with
    a few insignificant additions as mentioned above, appeared
    a few years later, from the last issue of which the present
    translation has been selected.</p>
<p>M. Brunet remarks in his preface, that &ldquo;Madame had
    the habit of reproducing almost in the same terms the details
    which she gave of the same events to diverse persons.
    She wrote with extreme rapidity, passing, without any
    transition, from one subject to another, piling up useless
    words and insignificant particulars which it would be quite
    absurd to try to reproduce. Expressions of regret at the
    deaths or the illnesses of Madame&rsquo;s numerous relatives, interminable
    protestations of friendship, wearisome repetitions,
    swelled beyond all measure the letters that came into the
    hands of M. Menzel, who cut off two-thirds of them, preserving
    such parts only as had a more or less general interest
    and an historical value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following letters are almost exclusively addressed to
    her half-sisters, and chiefly to the Comtesse Louise, the
    Comtesse Amélie having died in 1709. The names of her
    correspondents do not precede the letters in the French
    edition, except in a few instances.</p>
<p>Madame needs no interpreter, for even her vituperative
    faculty conveys its own correction; her hatred to Mme. de
    Maintenon becomes amusing, and we are quite able to see
    the justice and the injustice of it. Her favourite term for
    her enemy is, however, so outrageous (<i>la vieille guenipe</i>, the
    old slut, or any such equivalent&mdash;once she descends to
    saying <i>la vieille truie</i>) that it is more agreeable to the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> to keep the word in French than to constantly repeat it in
    English.</p>
<p>Madame died on the 8th of December, 1722, at the age
    of seventy, just one year before the death of her son, the
    regent. She was buried in Saint-Denis, and Massillon pronounced
    her funeral oration.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>The letters of Adélaïde de Savoie, Duchesse de Bourgogne
    and dauphine, are of little value, as the reader will see, if
    judged historically, or as a document on the manners and
    customs of a period. They are placed here as a contemporary
    record of a tender and pathetic young life on its
    passage, through frivolity and ill-health, to a premature
    death just as age had corrected her defects, and the prospect
    of being, with her husband, the blessing and salvation
    of France was dawning before her.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>Sainte-Beuve possessed a natural spirit of justice which
    led him (though it did not invariably rule him) to satisfy
    his literary conscience by returning to the portraits of his
    personages to correct, modify, and balance his first impressions.
    It is in this spirit that his picture of Mme. de
    Maintenon and Saint-Cyr, followed by a number of her own
    letters and papers on that section of her life, are given
    here to succeed the prejudiced statements of her two greatest
    enemies, Saint-Simon and Madame. The picture of Saint-Cyr
    stands apart in Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s career in a frame
    of its own; it shows her at her very best and as she herself
    would fain appear to posterity. It is the other extreme of
    the portraiture, and the reader must form his own judgment
    as to how the full truth of the nature and conduct of this
    remarkable woman can be evolved.</p>

</p>
<p class="sig"> <span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, 1695.<br />
</p>
<p>King James of England is not willing that we should wear
    mourning for his daughter [Mary]; he has vehemently insisted
    that nothing of the kind should be done. He is not
    at all moved by this death, which surprises me, for I should
    think a man could not forget his children, no matter what
    wrongs he has against them; blood must surely keep its
    strength. From the portrait they made me of Prince [King]
    William, I should not have thought he was so much attached
    to his wife; and I like him for it.</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear that Charles-Maurice [her half-brother]
    loves me, though he has never seen me; that is the
    effect of blood. It is not surprising that I love him, for I
    saw him come into the world; and besides, I have always
    retained such respect for his Highness our father that I love
    all those who are his children. I wish that Charles-Maurice
    may soon be made a colonel. We die when our time comes;
    Maurice will not live beyond the period that fate assigns
    him, whether he stays at Court or goes to war. He had
    better follow his inclination, for all that is done from liking
    is better done than when one yields to constraint.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>We have here a Comte de Nassau, a very brave man and
    much respected. He holds a patent from the emperor authorizing
    him to take the title of prince; but he makes no
    use of it, for which I think very well of him. Dancing has
    gone out of fashion everywhere. Here, in France, as soon
    as the company assemble they do nothing but play <i>lansquenet</i>;
    that is the game in vogue; even the young people do
    not care to dance. As for me, I do neither. I am much too
    old to dance, which I have not done since the death of our
    father. I never play cards for two reasons: first, I have no
    money; and next, I don&rsquo;t like gambling. They play here
    for frightful sums, and the players are like madmen; one
    howls, another strikes the table so hard that the room resounds,
    a third blasphemes in such a way that one&rsquo;s hair
    stands on end, and they all seem beside themselves and are
    terrifying to see.</p>
<p>I beg you to greet for me all our old friends in the Palatinate;
    I curse this war to-day more than ever. My poor
    son, who has been seriously ill and is still taking quinine,
    was engaged in that affair when Maréchal de Villeroy fell
    upon the rear-guard of the Prince de Vaudemont and put
    four battalions to flight. Though my son has had the luck
    to escape a wound, I tremble lest fatigue should bring back
    his fever. A good peace is much to be desired.</p>
<p>I regard it as great praise that people should say I have a
    German heart and that I love my country; I shall endeavour,
    by the grace of God, to deserve that praise to my
    last day. I have indeed a German heart, for I cannot console
    myself for what is happening in that unfortunate Palatinate;
    I cannot think about it; it makes me sad all day.
    Next Saturday I return, with regret, to Paris, which I think
    very disagreeable.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the world so miserable as the fate of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> Queen of Spain; I know this by the late queen, who used
    to write me day by day the existence that she led. It is
    even worse in Portugal, and it shows the truth of the proverb
    that all is not gold that glitters.</p>
<p>I was too old when I came to France to change my character,
    the foundations were laid. There is nothing surprising
    in that; but I should be inexcusable if I were false and did
    not love the persons for whom I ought to feel an attachment.
    You have reason to think that I write as I think; I am too
    frank to write otherwise. The good Duchesse de Guise,
    cousin of the king and of Monsieur, died five days ago. I
    have felt much afflicted; she was a worthy, pious woman;
    we dined together every day. There was only an antechamber
    between my room and her cabinet. She kept her
    mind till the last moment, and died tranquilly, without
    regrets.</p>

<p>If I had not heard from my aunt that you were going to
    Holland, I should have been quite surprised at getting your
    letter from the Hague. My health is now pretty good; as
    usual, I have driven away the fever by hunting. I have had
    the satisfaction to do some service to the prisoners who have
    been brought here. I cannot do much, but I shall spare no
    pains to be useful to compatriots who may need me.</p>
<p>I remember the Hague perfectly; I always thought it a
    very agreeable city, but the air is not as good as it is in the
    Palatinate and everything is so very dear in Holland. King
    William is not at Loo, but at the head of his army; God
    grant there may not be a battle, for I can&rsquo;t help trembling at
    the thought of it because of my son. The fate of those good
    people of the Palatinate makes me wretched; but I can do
    nothing to prevent it. Let us all unite in prayers for
    peace, for it is indeed very needful.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>It is deplorable that the priests have brought it about
    that Christians are divided one against another. If I had
    my way, the three Christian religions should form but one;
    we should not ask what people believed, but whether
    they lived in accordance with the Gospel, and the priests
    should preach against those who lead bad lives. Christians
    ought to be allowed to marry and go to church where
    they like; and then there would be more harmony than
    there is now.</p>
<p>I think so well of King William that I would rather have
    him for a son-in-law than the Emperor of Germany. I can
    say with truth of my daughter that she has no idea of coquetry
    or gallantry; in that respect she gives me no anxiety,
    and I think I shall never have anything to fear; she is not
    handsome, but she has a pretty figure, a good face, and good
    feelings. I am convinced that she will stay an old maid, for,
    according to all appearance, King William will marry the
    Princess of Denmark. I fancy that the emperor will take
    the second Princess of Savoie, and the Duc de Lorraine the
    daughter of the emperor, so that no one will be left for my
    daughter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember how gay I was in my
    youth; all that has gone; I have been more than six weeks
    without laughing even once. The theatre is what amuses
    me the most. If you knew all that goes on here you would
    certainly not be surprised that I am no longer gay. Another
    in my place would have been dead of grief this long while;
    as for me, I only grow fat upon it.</p>

<p>I received two weeks ago your letter of May 21, but I
    could not answer it, for I was not in a state to write, and
    Mlle. de Rathsamhausen [her lady-of-honour] spells so badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> that I do not care to dictate to her.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I must tell you what
    has happened to me. Once a month I go with Monseigneur
    the dauphin to hunt a wolf. It had rained; the
    ground was slippery; we had searched for a wolf two hours
    without finding one, and then started for another point, where
    we hoped to do better. As we were following a wood-path a
    wolf sprang up just in front of my horse, which was frightened
    and reared on its hind legs and slipped and fell over on
    its right side, and my elbow coming in contact with a big
    stone was dislocated. They looked for the king&rsquo;s surgeon
    who was with the hunt, but could not find him, for his horse
    had lost a shoe and he had gone to a village to have it put
    on. A peasant said there was a very skilful barber two
    leagues off who set legs and arms every day of his life;
    when I heard he had such experience I got into a calèche
    and was driven to him&mdash;not without very great pain. As
    soon as he had set my arm I suffered nothing and drove back
    here at once. My surgeon and Monsieur&rsquo;s surgeon examined
    the hurt. I think they were rather jealous that a poor
    countryman had done the thing so well. They bandaged my
    arm again and made me suffer beyond measure; my hand
    swelled up in a horrible manner; I could not move my wrist
    or lift my hand to my mouth.</p>
<p>It is very true that celibacy is the best condition; the
    best of men is not worth the devil. Love in marriage is
    no longer the fashion, and is thought ridiculous. The Catholics
    here say in their catechism that marriage is a sacrament,
    but, in point of fact, they live with their wives as if it were
    no sacrament at all, and, what is worse, nothing is more
    approved than to see men have gallantries and desert their
    wives&mdash;But not to enlarge upon this subject, I will talk
    to you about my wolf.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>You have heard by this time that peace has been signed
    with the emperor and the empire; that is a great step towards
    a general peace. I do not think that war will break out in
    Poland, for it is not at all certain that our Prince de Conti
    will go there; he may renounce it, which I think would be
    much better for him than the crown of Poland; it is a savage,
    dirty country, and the nobles are too ambitious.</p>
<p>These are dangerous times for young men, and they would
    do better to go and seek honour in war than stay here doing
    nothing and leading the most dissolute lives, for which, be it
    said between you and me, my son has but too great a liking.
    He says he has taste only for women and not for other debauchery,
    which is as common here as it is in Italy, and
    therefore he thinks we ought to praise him and be grateful
    to him; but his behaviour does not please me at all.</p>
<p>Those who do not know the exact situation of things here
    imagine that the king and Court are just what they used to
    be; but everything is changed in a sorry way. If any one
    who had left the Court at the time of the queen&rsquo;s death returned
    here now he would think he had stepped into another
    world. There is much to be said about this, but I cannot
    confide it to paper, because all letters are opened and read.
    My aunt used to say that everybody here below is a demon
    charged to torment somebody else; and that is very true.
    We know that all things are the result of the will of God,
    and happen as He has fixed from all eternity, but the Almighty
    not having consulted us on what He meant to do, we
    are in ignorance of the causes of what we see going on
    about us.</p>

<p>I have not written to you for several days because I have
    been to Montargis, whence we have come back here, where
    we found the courier who brought us the dispensation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> my daughter&rsquo;s marriage. It will take place Monday next
    and two days later she will start. [Mlle. de Chartres
    married Léopold, Duc de Lorraine, and was the mother of
    Francis I., Emperor of Germany, the husband of Maria
    Theresa.] You can easily imagine that my heart is full,
    and that I am nearer to weeping than laughing, for my
    daughter and I have never been separated, and now we are
    to part for a long time. My eyes are full of tears, but I
    must hide them; otherwise people would laugh at me, for
    in this country they do not understand how it is that persons
    should love their relations. One repents very soon of
    speaking out one&rsquo;s thoughts, and that is why I live such a
    solitary life. You are very happy in being able to laugh
    still; it is a long time since I have done so, though formerly
    I used to laugh more than any one. Persons have only to
    marry in France and the desire to laugh will soon leave
    them.</p>
<p>The King of England is not, I think, in much of a hurry
    to be married. That monarch is certainly, on account of
    his merit, one of the greatest kings that ever wore a crown;
    but between ourselves, if I were maid or widow and he did
    me the honour to want to marry me, I would rather pass my
    life in celibacy than become the greatest queen in the world
    on condition of taking a husband, for marriage has become
    to me an object of horror.</p>
<p>What is worse in this country than in England is
    that all the persons who conduct themselves ill, men and
    women, devote themselves to politics and seek to intrigue
    at Court, which leads to much perfidy and deception.
    In whatever country we live, if we are married we must
    drive jealousy out of our hearts, for it does no good; we
    must wash our hands in innocency and keep our conscience
    pure, although we may have no pleasant intercourse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> nothing but long and weary hours of ennui. I do not fret
    myself now about the way the world goes on; I despise it,
    and I have little taste for being in society. One hears of
    nothing just now but tragical events; they have lately condemned
    five women who killed their husbands; others killed
    themselves.</p>
<p>Nothing is so rare in France as Christian faith; there is
    no longer any vice of which persons are ashamed. If the
    king wanted to punish all those who are guilty of the worst
    vices he would find no more princes or nobles or servants
    about him; there would not be a family in France that was
    not in mourning.</p>

<p>I receive sometimes very friendly letters from the Queen
    of Spain [wife of Charles II.]. I am sorry that poor queen
    is so unhappy. It would be a great blessing for Europe if
    she could have a child, boy or girl would do, provided it
    lived; for one does not need to be a prophet to divine that if
    the King of Spain dies without children a terrible war will
    arise; all the Powers will claim the succession, and none of
    them will yield to any of the others; nothing but a war
    can decide.</p>
<p>I have heard with grief of the conduct of Charles-Maurice
    in Berlin; if he behaves in that way we shall not continue
    good friends. I am very angry to know that he is dead-drunk
    nearly half the day. If I thought that scolding him
    very severely would correct him I would write to him. It
    is distressing to think that the only remaining son of our
    father should be a drunkard.</p>

<p>It is not a mere tale that the King of Morocco has asked
    in marriage the Princesse de Conti [daughter of Louis XIV.
    and Louise de la Vallière], but the king repulsed the proposal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> sharply. That princess was extremely beautiful before
    she had the small-pox, but her illness has greatly changed
    her. She still has a perfect figure and charming carriage,
    and dances admirably; I never saw any engraved portrait
    that was like her.</p>
<p>I can understand why people go to Rome, like my cousin
    the Landgrave of Cassel, to see the antiquities, but I cannot
    imagine that they should go to be present at all those priests&rsquo;
    ceremonies, for nothing is more tiresome. Perhaps some
    people go for the thirty thousand <i>dames galantes</i> who are
    said to be there; but those who like such merchandise have
    only to come to France, where they will find them in abundance.
    Those who want to repent of their sins need not go
    to Rome; to repent sincerely in their own homes is quite as
    profitable. Here no one cares about Rome or the pope;
    they are quite convinced they can get to heaven without him.</p>
<p>I seldom see Monsieur here [Marly]; we do not dine
    together; he plays cards all day, and at night we are each
    in our own room. Monsieur has the weakness to think that
    when he is overlooked at cards he has ill-luck; so I never
    assist at his games. He has frightened us very much by
    having a quartan fever; this is the day it is due to return,
    but, thanks to God, he feels nothing of it yet, and he is in
    the salon, playing cards.</p>
<p>All letters entering or leaving France are opened; I know
    that very well, but it does not trouble me; I continue to
    write what comes into my head.</p>

<p>If I had not had fever and great agitation, Madame, from
    the sad employment of yesterday in opening the caskets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> Monsieur&rsquo;s papers, scented with the most violent perfumes,
    you would have heard from me earlier; but I can no longer
    delay expressing to you how touched I am by the favours
    that the king did yesterday to my son, and the manner in
    which he has treated both him and myself; and as all this
    is the result of your good counsels, Madame, be pleased to
    allow me to express my sense of it and to assure you that I
    shall keep, very inviolably, the promise of friendship which
    I made to you; I beg you to continue to me your counsels
    and advice, and not to doubt a gratitude which can end only

</p>
<p>My health is still much weakened; this is the first time
    for eight days that the fever has left me. Since the blow
    that struck me I have had eighteen paroxysms of fever, and
    I thought it was the will of God to end my sad life; but it
    was not so. I am left with great lassitude and weakness
    of the legs, which I attribute to the shock of Monsieur&rsquo;s
    death; they continued to tremble for twenty-four hours as
    if from a violent attack of fever. Nothing could have been
    more dreadful than what I witnessed. At nine o&rsquo;clock in
    the evening Monsieur left my room, gay and laughing; at
    half-past ten they called me, and I found him almost unconscious;
    but he recognized me and said a few words with
    much difficulty. I stayed the whole night beside him, and
    the next morning at six o&rsquo;clock, when there was no longer
    any hope, they carried me away unconscious.</p>
<p>I am grateful to you for the share you take in my misfortune,
    which is dreadful, and I thank you with all my heart.
    I beg you to let the Queen-dowager of Denmark know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> much I am touched that her Majesty has remembered me
    in my trouble.</p>
<p>I have need to find, in my sad situation, something to
    divert my thoughts; everything is forbidden to me at
    present except walking; my greatest comfort is the kindness
    of the king, of which he continues to give me many
    proofs. He comes to see me and takes me to walk with
    him. Saturday was the day when Monsieur was interred,
    and though I was not present, I wept much, as you can well
    imagine.</p>
<p>I have every reason to rejoice in the king&rsquo;s favour, and so
    has my son, whom the king has made a very great seigneur.
    I am well pleased for him; we live happily together; he is
    a good lad with very good feelings.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig">October, 1701.<br />
</p>
<p>My health is now perfect, and to keep it so I drive out as
    much as I can. All the others hunt daily with the king, and
    go twice a week to the theatre. I am deprived of those
    things, as you know, and between ourselves, it is not a little
    privation to be obliged to forego those two amusements. I
    walk out often on foot and go a good three miles in the
    forest; that disperses the melancholy that would otherwise
    crush me; especially when I hear talk about public affairs of
    which I had previously never heard a word in all my life. I
    should be very fortunate if I could understand them as you
    do, but I never could, and at fifty one is too old to begin to
    learn; I should only make myself as annoying and irritating
    as a bed-bug. Apropos of bed-bugs, they nearly ate up the
    little Queen of Spain on her passage up the Mediterranean
    in the Spanish galleys. Her people were obliged to sit up
    with her all night. She arrived a few days ago at Toulon,
    and went from there by land to Barcelona because, so she
    wrote me, she could not endure the sea any longer. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> would not be in her place; to be a queen is painful in any
    country, but to be Queen of Spain is worst of all.</p>
<p>I must acknowledge that the death of King James has
    made me very sad; his widow is in a situation to melt a
    heart of rock. The good king died with a firmness I cannot
    describe, and with as much tranquillity as if he were going
    to sleep. The evening before his death he said: &ldquo;I forgive
    my daughter with all my heart for the harm she did
    me; and I pray God to pardon her, and also the Prince of
    Orange and all my other enemies.&rdquo; The Queen of England
    cannot be consoled for the death of her husband, though she
    bears her sorrow with Christian resignation. I have nothing
    new to tell you; I walk and read and write; sometimes the
    king drives me to the hunt in his calèche. There are hunts
    every day; Sundays and Wednesdays are my son&rsquo;s days;
    the king hunts Mondays and Thursdays; Wednesdays and
    Saturdays Monseigneur hunts the wolf; M. le Comte de
    Toulouse, Mondays and Wednesdays; the Duc du Maine,
    Tuesdays; and M. le Duc, Fridays. They say if all the
    hunting kennels were united there would be from 900 to
    1000 dogs. Twice a week there is a comedy. But you
    know, of course, that I go nowhere; which vexes me, for
    I must own that the theatre is the greatest amusement
    I have in the world, and the only pleasure that remains
    to me.</p>
<p>You are wrong in supposing that I have ceased to read the
    Bible; I read three chapters every morning. You ought not
    to imagine that French Catholics are as silly as German
    Catholics; it is quite another thing,&mdash;one might almost
    say it is another religion. Any one reads Holy Scripture
    who chooses. Nobody here thinks the pope infallible, and
    when he excommunicated Lavardin in Rome everybody
    laughed and never dreamed of a pilgrimage. There is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> much difference in France from the Catholic of Germany as
    there is from those of Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>Those who wish to serve God in truth and according to
    His word should read Holy Scripture every day; otherwise
    we sit in darkness. I am persuaded that good religion is
    founded on the word of God, and consists in having Jesus
    Christ in the heart; all the rest is only the prating of priests.
    Of whatever religion we be, it is only by works that true
    faith is shown, and only by them can it be judged who does
    right. To love God and our neighbour is the law and the
    prophets, as our Lord Jesus Christ teaches us.</p>
<p>I heard yesterday, through a letter from my aunt, the
    Electress of Brunswick, of the death of our poor Charles-Maurice.
    I am sincerely afflicted by it, and I pity you from
    the bottom of my heart. If Charles-Maurice had not loved
    wine so much he would have been a perfect philosopher.
    He has paid dear for his fault, for I am sure that drunkenness
    shortened his life; he could not keep from drinking,
    and he burnt up his body.</p>
<p>If the Court of France was what it used to be one might
    learn here how to behave in society; but&mdash;excepting the
    king and Monsieur&mdash;no one any longer knows what politeness
    is. The young men think only of horrible debauchery.
    I do not advise any one to send their children here; for instead
    of learning good things, they will only take lessons in
    misconduct. You are right in blaming Germans who send
    their sons to France; how I wish that you and I were men
    and could go to the wars!&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a completely useless
    wish to have. The higher one&rsquo;s position in life the more
    polite we ought to be in order to set a good example to
    others. It is impossible to be more polite than the king;
    but his children and grandchildren are not so at all. If I
    could with propriety return to Germany you would see me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> there quickly. I love that country; I think it more agreeable
    than all others, because there is less of luxury that I do
    not care for, and more of the frankness and integrity which
    I seek. But, be it said between ourselves, I was placed here
    against my will, and here I must stay till I die. There is
    no likelihood that we shall see each other again in this life;
    and what will become of us after that God only knows.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, 1704.<br />
</p>
<p>There are very few women here who are not coquettes by
    nature; it is excessively rare to meet any. Before God that
    is perhaps very reprehensible, but before men it is thought
    a fair game. The coquettes flatter themselves that, our Lord
    having shown in Holy Scripture so much charity for persons
    of their stripe, he will certainly have compassion for them;
    the cases of Mary Magdalen, of the Samaritan woman, and of
    the woman taken in adultery make them easy in mind. You
    must not think that they ever tire of coquetry; they cannot
    do without it, so to speak, and they never get tired of it.
    Drunkenness is but too much the fashion among the young
    women; but just now they are all in a state of complete
    satisfaction. Nothing is thought of but how to amuse the
    Duchesse de Bourgogne with collations, presents, fireworks,
    and other rejoicings:</p>
<p>I have not been able to perform the good work of keeping
    fast this Lent. I cannot endure fish, and I am quite convinced
    that we can do better works than spoiling our stomachs
    by eating too much of it.</p>
<p>Are you simple enough to believe that Catholics have none
    of the true foundations of Christianity? Believe me, the
    aim of Christianity is the same in all Christians; the differences
    that we see are only priests&rsquo; jargon, which does not
    concern honest men. What does concern us is to live well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> as Christians, to be merciful, and to apply ourselves to
    charity and virtue. Preachers ought to recommend all that
    to Christians, and not squabble as they do over quantities of
    points, as if they understood them; but this, of course, would
    diminish the authority of those gentlemen, and so they busy
    themselves with disputes, and not with what is more necessary
    and most essential.</p>
<p>I have in no way approved of the ill-treatment of the
    Reformers; but as to that, one must blame politics, which
    is a subject to be treated of <i>tête-à-tête</i> and not touched upon
    by way of the post. I shall therefore follow your good
    example and write of something else.</p>
<p>The jubilee bull has not converted all the abbés, for there
    are still a goodly number of them in Paris who court the
    women. I never in my life could understand how any one
    could fall in love with an ecclesiastic. Neither you nor your
    sister are coquettes; I can truly say I recognize my blood.
    What prevents one here from contracting sincere friendships
    is that one can never be sure of reciprocity; there is so much
    egotism and duplicity. And so one must either live in a
    very sad and wearisome solitude, or resign one&rsquo;s self to many
    griefs.</p>

<p>I was never scolded for sleeping in church, and so I have
    acquired a habit of it which I cannot get rid of. In the
    mornings I do not go to sleep; but in the evenings, after
    dinner, it is impossible for me to keep awake. I never sleep
    at the theatre, but I do, very often, at the opera. I believe
    the devil cares very little whether I sleep or not in church;
    sleep is not a sin, but the result of human weakness. I see
    you are too devout to go to the theatre on Sunday; but I
    think that visiting is more dangerous than the theatre; for
    it is difficult in a visit not to say harm of your neighbour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> which is a much worse sin than seeing a comedy. I should
    never approve of going to the theatre instead of going to
    church; but after having fulfilled one&rsquo;s duties to God, I
    think the theatre is less dangerous for a scrupulous conscience
    than conversation.</p>
<p>Many Frenchwomen, especially those who have been
    coquettish and debauched, as soon as they grow old and can
    no longer have lovers, make themselves devout&mdash;or, at least,
    they say they are. Usually such women are very dangerous;
    they are envious and cannot endure others. But I must stop,
    my dear Louise; I am sweating in a terrible way. The heat
    is extraordinary; it is two months since a drop of rain has
    fallen, and the leaves are frying on the trees.</p>
<p>I know very well what it is to be exposed in hunting to
    a burning sun; many a time I have stayed with the hounds
    from early morning till five in the evening, and in summer
    till nine at night. I come in red as a lobster, with my face
    all burned; that is why my skin is so rough and brown.
    No one pays any attention here to the dust; I have seen in
    travelling such clouds of it that we could not see each other
    in the coach, and yet the king never ordered the horsemen
    to keep back. The good night air does no one any harm;
    at Marly I often walk out by moonlight.</p>

<p>Amélie [another sister, Comtesse Palatine] writes me that
    she has answered the king of Prussia, and makes many
    jokes about it. I would reply to her in the same tone, but
    since the day before yesterday I have lost all desire to laugh
    and joke. We received news that, the orders of my son
    [with the army of Italy] not having been followed, the
    lines before Turin have been forced; my son has two severe
    wounds: one in the thigh, but a flesh wound only; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> other through the right arm, without the bone being broken.
    The surgeons assure us there is no danger to life; God grant
    it! For two days I have done nothing but weep; they tell
    me he is not in danger, but his sufferings grieve me; my
    eyes are so swollen and red I cannot see out of them.</p>
<p>The siege of Turin and the catastrophe that has ended it,
    almost costing me the life of my son, makes me sigh more
    than ever for peace. I have been so harassed for the last
    three days that I think I should have lost my mind if the
    anxiety had lasted longer. I have constantly said that they
    ought to make those two kings of Spain [she means the
    claimants of the throne, Philippe V. and the Archduke
    Charles] wrestle together, and whichever had the strongest
    wrist should win; such a singular combat to settle the fate
    of a kingdom would be more Christian than to shed the
    blood of so many men.</p>
<p>We have here a species of pietists who are what they call
    quietists; but they are much better than the pietists of
    Germany; they are not so debauched. The King of Siam,
    when our king wanted to convert him to Christianity, replied
    that he thought people could be saved in all religions,
    and that God, who had willed that the leaves of the trees
    should be of different colored greens, wished to be worshipped
    in diverse manners; therefore the King of France
    ought to continue to serve God in the way to which he
    was accustomed; while, for himself, he should adore God
    in his way, and if God wished him to change He would
    inspire him with the will to do so. I think that king was
    not far wrong. I believe that a long time will elapse before
    the last judgment; we have not yet seen Antichrist.</p>
<p>I thank you for the medals you have sent me; but I
    should like to receive those that are made against France.
    I already have the most insulting,&mdash;those that were struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> in the reign of King William. The king and the ministers
    have them, therefore you need not hesitate to send them
    to me on the first occasion.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p>I have received your letters from Heidelberg and Frankfort,
    and I answered them; but my letters to you, dear Louise,
    are all in the packet to my aunt which has been detained so
    long that we are nearly crazy about it. But that is what the
    all-powerful dame and the ministers succeed in&mdash;far better
    than they do in governing the kingdom.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, 1709.<br />
</p>
<p>Never in my life did I know so gloomy a period. The
    people are dying of cold like flies. The mills are stopped,
    and that has forced many to die of hunger. Yesterday
    they told me a sorrowful story about a woman who stole
    a loaf of bread from a baker&rsquo;s shop in Paris. The baker
    wanted to arrest her; she said, weeping, &ldquo;If you knew my
    misery you would not take the loaf away from me; I have
    three little children all naked; they ask me for bread; I
    cannot bear it, and that is why I have stolen the loaf.&rdquo;
    The commissary before whom they took the woman told
    her to take him where she lived; he went there, and found
    the three little children sitting in a corner under a heap of
    rags, trembling with cold as if they had the ague. &ldquo;Where
    is your father?&rdquo; he asked the eldest. The child answered,
    &ldquo;Behind the door.&rdquo; The commissary looked to see why the
    father was hiding behind the door, and recoiled with horror&mdash;the
    man had hung himself in despair. Such things are
    happening daily.</p>
<p>I am very much deserted here, for every one, young and
    old, runs after favour. The Maintenon cannot endure me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> and the Duchesse de Bourgogne likes only what that lady
    likes. I have done my best to conciliate that all-powerful
    person, but I cannot succeed in doing so. So I am excluded
    from everything, and I never see the king except at supper.
    I can only act according to the will of others. I was less
    bound when Monsieur was living. I dare not sleep away
    from Versailles without the king&rsquo;s permission. It is not
    wrong, therefore, that I should wish to be with you in our
    dear Palatinate; but God does not will that here below we
    should be fully satisfied. You and Amélie are free, but your
    health is bad; I am lonely, but my health, thank God, is
    perfect.</p>
<p>You are mistaken if you think that no lamentations are
    heard here; night and day we hear of nothing else; the
    famine is so great that children have eaten each other. The
    king is so determined to continue the war that yesterday he
    gave up his gold service and now uses porcelain; he has
    sent every gold thing he has to the mint to be turned into
    coin.</p>
<p>All that one sees and hears is dreadful; we are living in
    a very fatal epoch. If one leaves the house one is followed
    by a crowd of poor creatures who cry famine; all payments
    are made in notes; there is no coin anywhere; all one&rsquo;s contentment
    is destroyed till better days appear.</p>
<p>The old lady who is here in such great favour hates me;
    I have done my best to obtain her good will, but I cannot
    succeed; she has vowed to me and to my son an implacable
    hatred. One must do what is reasonable and walk a straight
    path: God will see to it all.</p>
<p>But that all-powerful lady has always been against me.
    In the days of Monsieur his favourites feared that I should
    tell the king how they pillaged Monsieur, and how they
    troubled me with their profligate lives, and so they wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> get that lady on their side; and to do so, they told her they
    knew her life, and that if she was not for them, they would
    tell all to the king.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> (I knew from the lady herself that a
    union existed between them, but she did not tell me its
    cause, which I learned from a friend of the Chevalier de
    Lorraine.) She has persecuted me all her life, and she does
    not trust a hair of my head because she thinks me as vindictive
    as she is herself&mdash;which I am not&mdash;and so she tries to
    keep me away from the king. There is another reason
    besides: the affection that she has for the Duchesse de
    Bourgogne. As she knows very well that the king, whom I
    love and respect much, has no antipathy to me, and that my
    natural humour does not displease him, she is afraid that he
    might prefer a woman of my age to so young a princess as
    the Duchesse de Bourgogne; and that is one reason why she
    wants to keep me away from the king&mdash;which she takes
    every possible means to do, so that there is no chance of
    changing matters.</p>

<p>I wish you could be with us here, just to see how beautiful
    the gardens are; but one ought to be able to walk about
    them with kind and agreeable people, and not with persons
    who hate and despise one another mutually,&mdash;sentiments
    that are met with here more frequently than those of friendship.
    Last Wednesday I went to Paris; every one was in
    alarm about the bread-famine. As I was going to the
    Palais-Royal, the people called out to me: &ldquo;There is a riot;
    forty persons are killed already.&rdquo; An hour later the Maréchal
    de Boufflers and the Duc de Grammont had appeased it
    all; we went tranquilly to the opera and returned to Versailles
    on Saturday.</p>

</p>
<p>I have to inform you of the marriage of my grand-daughter
    [Marie-Louise-Élisabeth] to the Duc de Berry. Monday,
    the king came to my room at Marly and announced to me
    that he should declare it publicly the next day. I had been
    told of it the night before, with an express injunction not to
    breathe it to a living soul. Tuesday I went to Saint-Cloud
    to congratulate the princess; Wednesday she came to Marly;
    her mother and I presented her to the king, who kissed her
    and presented her to her future husband. She will be fifteen
    in August, and she is already two inches taller than I. The
    dispensations from Rome have been sent for, and as soon as
    they arrive the marriage will take place. I own it causes
    me a most sincere joy.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, July, 1710.<br />
</p>
<p>This afternoon at five o&rsquo;clock the contract will be signed
    in the king&rsquo;s cabinet, and the marriage will take place on the
    11th, in the morning, without any pomp; but at night there
    is to be a grand reception and supper, with the king, of all the
    royal family. It is a very queer history how this marriage
    was brought about; but it cannot be written <i>by post</i>; it is
    to hatred rather than attachment that we owe it; but, at any
    rate, this marriage is better assorted than that of the Landgrave
    of Homburg, for the husband is nine years older than
    the wife, which is much better than when the wife is older
    than the husband.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Marly</span>, April, 1711.<br />
</p>
<p>We have just met with a great misfortune. Monsieur le
    dauphin [Monseigneur] died on Friday, at eleven o&rsquo;clock in
    the evening, just as they thought him out of danger. He
    first had a putrid fever, which changed into small-pox, to
    which he succumbed. The king spent the night with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> but forbade us to go there. I went to see Monseigneur&rsquo;s
    children and found them in a state that would have melted
    the heart of stones.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The king is extremely affected, but he
    shows a firmness and a submission to the will of God which
    I cannot express. He speaks to every one, and gives orders
    with resignation. What consoles him is that Monseigneur&rsquo;s
    confessor assures him that his conscience was in a very satisfactory
    state; he had taken the communion at Easter and he
    died in very religious sentiments. The king expresses himself
    in such a Christian way that it goes to my heart, and I
    cried all day long yesterday.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, May, 1711.<br />
</p>
<p>I am unworthy to hear good sermons, for I cannot help
    sleeping; the tones of the preachers&rsquo; voices send me off at
    once. We are here in the greatest grief. I have told you
    already how poor Monsieur le dauphin died unexpectedly.
    His illness was dreadful. The Duchesse de Villeroy only
    spoke to her husband, who had been in the dauphin&rsquo;s room
    at Meudon, and she was infected and died of it.</p>
<p>The king is a good Christian, but very ignorant in matters
    of religion. He has never in his life read the Bible; he believes
    all the priests and the canting bigots tell him; it is
    therefore no wonder he goes astray. They tell him he must
    act in such and such a way; he knows no better, and thinks
    he will be damned if he listens to other advice than that of
    his regular counsellors.</p>
<p>The dauphin was not without intelligence; he was quick
    to seize on all absurdities, his own as well as those of others.
    He could relate things very amusingly when he chose, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> his laziness was such that it made him neglect everything.
    He would much have preferred an indolent life to the possession
    of all empires and kingdoms. In his life he never
    opposed the king&rsquo;s wishes, and he was as submissive as anybody
    to the Maintenon. Those who assert that he would
    have retired from Court had the king announced his marriage
    to the <i>guenipe</i> did not know him; he had himself a
    villanous <i>guenipe</i> for mistress, whom it was thought he had
    married secretly; her name was Mlle. Choin; she is still in
    Paris. What prevented the old Maintenon from being declared
    queen were the good reasons given against it to the
    king by the Archbishop of Cambrai, M. de Fénelon; and
    that is why she persecuted that good and respectable prelate
    till his death.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, June, 1712.<br />
</p>
<p>I thank you for the share you take in my grief on account
    of the death of the great personages whom we have lost,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
    also on account of the frightful calumnies that are being
    spread about against my son, who is innocent. The fabricators
    of those lies are confounded, and now ask pardon: but
    was it not horrible to invent such tales?</p>
<p>I cannot endure either tea, coffee, or chocolate; what
    would give me pleasure is good beer-soup; but it cannot be
    procured here; beer in France is worthless.</p>
<p>I hoped that, the king having taken medicine yesterday,
    H. M. would not hunt to-day, and that I should thus have
    time to write you a reasonable letter; but the demon of contretemps,
    as they say here, has come and put himself against
    it. We hunted this morning, and I did not get back to dinner
    till mid-day; I have answered my aunt and written her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> fourteen sheets, so now I have but little time left before
    supper.</p>
<p>Happily for me I no longer like cards, for I am not rich
    enough to risk my whole fortune as other people do, and I
    have no taste for little stakes. Though I do not play, time
    does not seem long to me when I am alone in my cabinet.
    I have quite a fine collection of gold coins and medals; my
    aunt has given me others in silver and bronze; I have two
    or three hundred engraved antique stones; also many brass
    pieces which I like equally; I read with pleasure, and therefore
    I am never bored, be the weather good or bad; I have
    always something to do, and I write a great deal. When,
    in one day, I have written twenty sheets to H. H. the Princess
    of Wales, ten or twelve to my daughter, twenty in
    French to the Queen of Sicily [Anne-Marie, Monsieur&rsquo;s
    daughter by Henrietta of England] I am so tired that I cannot
    put one foot before the other.</p>

<p>We have lost the poor Duc de Berry, who was only
    twenty-seven years old, and was stout and so healthy he
    ought to have lived a hundred years. He shortened his
    life by his own imprudences&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t want to talk
    of such sad matters; it makes me sick at heart and does
    no good.</p>
<p>It is a good thing for me that he had ceased for several
    years to love me, otherwise I could not be comforted for his
    loss. I own that at first, and even for some days afterwards,
    I was greatly moved; but having reflected that if I had died
    he would only have laughed, I consoled myself promptly.</p>

<p>I cannot express the grief into which I am plunged by the
    death of my aunt [Sophia, Electress of Hanover, mother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> George I. of England, who had brought Madame up, being
    the sister of her father]; and I have, besides, the misery of
    being forced to suppress my sorrow, because the king cannot
    endure to see sad faces round him; I am obliged therefore
    to hunt as usual.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Letters of 1714-1716.</span></h3>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Fontainebleau</span>, 1714.</p>
<p>We are here since yesterday; having slept at the house of
    the Duc d&rsquo;Antin, called Petit-Bourg, a charming residence;
    the gardens, especially, are magnificent. I did not come
    with the king, because two days before leaving Versailles I
    caught a bad cold in my head accompanied by a terrible
    cough, and I feared to disgust the king and make the young
    people laugh by spitting and blowing my nose; so I came in
    my own carriage with my ladies and dogs. Yesterday they
    hunted, but I could not go; it used to be great pain to me to
    lose a hunt, but now I do not care.</p>

    <div class="caption"> <i>A Hunt at Fontainebleau</i></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>You think my life is spent in pleasure-parties and amusements;
    to undeceive you I will tell you just how my existence
    is regulated. Usually I get up at nine o&rsquo;clock; I go
    where you can guess; next, I say my prayers and read three
    chapters in the Bible, one in the Old Testament, one in the
    New, and a psalm; then I dress myself and receive the visits
    of many of the Court people; at eleven I return to my cabinet,
    where I read and write. At twelve I go to church;
    after which I dine alone, which amuses me very little, for I
    think there is nothing so tiresome as to be alone at table,
    surrounded by servants who look at everything you put in
    your mouth; and besides, though I have been here forty-three
    years, I have not yet accustomed myself to the detestable
    cooking of this country. After my dinner, which is
    usually over by a quarter to two, I return to my cabinet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> rest half an hour, and then I read and write till it is time for
    the king&rsquo;s supper; sometimes my ladies play <i>ombre</i> or <i>brelan</i> beside my table. Madame d&rsquo;Orléans or the Duchesse de
    Berry, or sometimes my son, comes to see me between half-past
    nine and ten. At a quarter to eleven we take our places
    at table and wait for the king, who sometimes does not come
    till half-past eleven; we sup without saying a word; then
    we pass into the king&rsquo;s room, where we stay about the length
    of a Pater; the king makes a bow and retires into his cabinet;
    we follow him,&mdash;though <i>I</i> have only done so since
    the death of the last dauphine; the king talks with us;
    at half-past twelve he says good-night, and all retire to
    their own apartments; I go to bed; Mme. la Duchesse
    plays cards, the game lasting all night till the next day.
    When there is comedy I go to it at seven o&rsquo;clock, and
    thence to the king&rsquo;s supper; when there is hunting it is
    always at one o&rsquo;clock; then I get up at eight and go to
    church at eleven.</p>
<p>I have seen Lord Peterborough twice; he said the oddest
    things; he has got a mind like the devil, but a very strange
    head, and he talks in a singular way. He said, in speaking
    of the two kings of Spain, &ldquo;We are great fools to let ourselves
    be killed for two such boobies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am really vexed that that old and odious Duchesse de
    Zell should still be living, whereas our dear electress is dead
    already.</p>
<p>You probably have heard of the taking of Barcelona. I
    approve of the people being faithful to a master so long as
    he shows himself worthy of their affection; but when he
    abandons them it would be better not to shed so much blood,
    and to submit peaceably. But those cursèd monks are afraid
    they cannot live as they choose and be respected as much as
    they have been under a king of France, and so they preached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> up and down the streets that Barcelona must not be surrendered.
    If my advice were followed they would put those
    rascals in the galleys, instead of the poor Reformers who are
    languishing there.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig">October, 1714.<br />
</p>
<p>This is, unhappily, the last letter that I shall write you
    from my dear Fontainebleau; we leave Wednesday, and on
    Monday our last hunt will take place in the beautiful forest.
    I feel that the fine air and exercise do me much good; they
    disperse and drive away sad thoughts, and nothing is so
    counter to my health as sadness. Last Thursday we hunted
    a stag that was rather malicious; but one gentleman slipped
    round a rock behind him and wounded him in the shoulder,
    so that not being able to butt with his head he was no longer
    dangerous. Behind my calèche was another carriage in
    which were three priests,&mdash;the Archbishop of Lyons and
    two abbés; fearing to be attacked by the stag two of them
    jumped out and flung themselves flat on their stomachs on
    the ground. I am sorry I did not see that scene, which
    would have made me laugh, for we old hunters are not so
    afraid of a stag.</p>
<p>As for what concerns our king in England [George I.] I
    find it hard to rejoice in his elevation, for I would not trust
    the English with a hair of my head. I have seen recently
    what the fine talk of my Lord Peterborough is worth. I
    wish that our elector, instead of becoming King of England,
    had been made Roman Emperor, and that the King of England
    who is here were in possession of the kingdom to which
    he has a right. I fear that those English, who are so inconstant,
    will do something before long which will not be to our
    liking. No one ever became king in a more brilliant manner
    than King James, being crowned amid cries of joy from
    the whole nation; yet his people persecuted him so pitilessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> that he could scarcely find a spot in which to rest after
    countless sufferings. If one could only trust the English I
    should say that it was well for the parliament to be over
    King George; but when one reads about the revolutions of
    the English one sees what eternal hatred they feel to kings,
    and also their inconstancy. The English cannot endure
    each other; we saw that at the Court of Saint-Germain;
    they lived there like cats and dogs. I never heard of that
    philosopher Spinoza; was he a Spaniard? the name sounds
    Spanish.</p>
<p>King George sent me word by M. Martini that as soon as
    he reached England he should write to me and keep up a
    correspondence. Yesterday M. Prior brought me a letter
    from the king, but it was written by a secretary and not by
    his own hand. I should not have expected that after the
    compliment by M. Martini; but I ought not to feel astonished
    when I think what that king has always been to me&mdash;just
    the reverse of his mother. Whatever happens, I shall
    ever remember that he is the son of my aunt, and I shall
    wish him all sorts of prosperity, as I have to-day written to
    him. The Princess of Wales grieves me; I esteem her sincerely,
    for I find the best sentiments in her&mdash;a rare thing
    at the present day.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, 1715.<br />
</p>
<p>Yesterday great news arrived about the Princesse des
    Ursins,&mdash;she who has so long governed Spain, and who had
    gone to meet the new queen, whose <i>camarera-mayor</i> she
    expected to be. Her pride has ruined her; she had written
    letters against the young queen, to whom they were
    shown. When she went to meet the queen she would only
    go half-way down the staircase; then she criticised her
    dress, and blamed her for being so long upon the road, and
    said that if she had been in the king&rsquo;s place she might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> sent her back.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Thereupon the queen ordered an officer of
    the body-guard to take that crazy woman out of her presence
    and arrest her, and at the same time she sent a courier to
    the king, making great complaints of the lady. The king
    answered that she could do what she liked in the matter.
    So at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night the princess was put into a
    carriage with a single maid, lacqueys, and guards, and orders
    were given to take her to France, which was done.</p>
<p>I cannot pity her, for she has always persecuted my son
    in a horrible manner; she persuaded the king and queen
    (the one that is dead) that my son wanted to dethrone them
    and was conspiring against their lives; which is so false
    that, do what she could, she was unable to justify her
    accusations, no matter how slightly, in the eyes of the
    world. For this reason I do not afflict myself at what has
    happened to her, and that is natural. I am uneasy lest that
    malignant devil should come here, for she would not fail to
    fling her poison on my son and on me, from which may God
    preserve us! I will tell you later whatever happens in
    regard to that old woman.</p>
<p>We have just received the sad news of the death of the
    Archbishop of Cambrai [Fénelon]. He is much regretted.
    He was a great friend to my son. Also the good Maréchal
    de Chamilly, who was a very brave and worthy man, died
    two days ago [The Marquis de Chamilly; to him were
    addressed the famous &ldquo;Portuguese Letters&rdquo;].</p>
<p>There is nothing new here. Everybody is talking of the
    Persian ambassador who made his entry yesterday, February
    6, into Paris. He is the oddest-looking being that was ever
    seen. He has brought a soothsayer with him, whom he
    consults on all occasions to know if days and hours are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> lucky or unlucky. If it is proposed to him to do anything
    and the day does not prove to be a lucky one, he flies into
    a fury, grinds his teeth, draws his sabre and his dagger,
    and wants to exterminate everybody. But I am called to
    go to church and I cannot tell you more just now.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig">April, 1715.<br />
</p>
<p>To-day I am, as they say in our dear Palatinate, as cross
    as a bed-bug; and I will give you one specimen. The king,
    wishing to reward the Princesse des Ursins, who has behaved
    so horribly to my son, trying to make him out a
    poisoner, has given her a pension of 40,000 francs. There
    are two other things that have put me out of temper, which
    are not worth more than that. Such injustices disgust one
    with life; but we must hold our tongue and never say what
    we think.</p>
<p>After dinner my grandson, the Duc de Chartres, came to
    see me, and I gave him an entertainment suited to his
    years: it was a triumphal car drawn by a big cat, in which
    was a little bitch named Andrienne; a pigeon served as
    coachman, two others were the pages, and a dog was the
    footman and sat behind. His name is Picard; and when
    the lady got out of the carriage Picard let down the steps.
    The cat is named Castille. Picard also allows himself to
    be saddled; we put a doll on his back and he does all that
    a circus horse would do. I have also a bitch, whom I call
    Badine, who knows the cards and will bring whichever I tell
    her&mdash;but enough of such nonsense.</p>
<p>England certainly owes much to the Duchess of Portsmouth.
    She is the best woman of that class that I ever
    saw in my life; she is extremely polite and is very agreeable
    company. In the days of Monsieur we often had her
    at Saint-Cloud; so I know her very well.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>You cannot be surprised, my dear Louise, if I often have
    reason to be sad; for you must have read the long letter
    I sent to my aunt, our dear electress, by the hands of
    M. de Wersebé. The rancour that the <i>vilaine</i> has against
    me will end only with her life; all that she can imagine
    to do me harm and grieve me she never omits. She is more
    angry with me now than ever because I would not see her
    great friend whom the Queen of Spain dismissed. My
    son had begged me not to see her, because she has a furious
    enmity against him and tried to make him out a poisoner.
    He has not been contented with proving his innocence; he
    has insisted that all the documents of the inquiry should be
    taken to Parliament and preserved there. It is therefore
    very natural that I should refuse to see such a woman; but
    the <i>vilaine</i> is angry&mdash;for like meets like, as the devil said
    to the coal-heaver. So I must take patience, and not look
    as if I resented the wrongs done to us.</p>
<p>This morning, as I was washing my hands, my son came
    into my room and made me a very fine present. He gave
    me seventeen antique gold coins, as fresh as if they had
    just come out of the mint. They were found near Modena,
    as you may have read in the Holland Gazette; he had them
    secretly carried to Rome. This attention on his part has
    given me the greatest pleasure,&mdash;not so much for the value
    of the present as for the attention.</p>
<p>As soon as I return to Versailles I will have a copy made
    of my portrait by Rigaud, who has seized my likeness in a
    wonderful manner; you will then see, my dear Louise, how
    old I have grown.</p>

</p>
<p>Our king is not well, and that worries me to the point of
    being half ill myself; I have lost both sleep and appetite.
    God grant I be mistaken, for if what I fear should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> happen it would be the greatest misfortune I could meet
    with. Were I to explain to you all that, you would see; it
    is so abominable that I cannot think of it without becoming
    goose-flesh. Say nothing to any one in England of what
    I have now said to you, but I am very anxious about it.</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon has not been ill; she is fresh and in
    good health; would to God that our king were as well, and
    then I should be less troubled than I am.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig">August 27th.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Louise</span>,&mdash;I am so troubled that I do not know
    any longer what I do or what I say; and yet I must answer
    your kind letter as best I can. I must first tell you we had
    yesterday the saddest and most touching scene that can be
    imagined. The king, after preparing himself for death, after
    having received the sacraments, had the dauphin brought to
    him, gave him his benediction, and talked to him. He sent
    for me next, also for the Duchesse de Berry and all his
    daughters and grandchildren. He bade me farewell in words
    so tender that I wonder I did not fall down senseless. He
    assured me that he had always loved me and more than I
    knew, and that he regretted to have sometimes caused me
    grief. He asked me to remember him sometimes, adding
    that he thought I should do so willingly, for he was certain
    I had always loved him. He said also that he gave me his
    blessing and offered prayers for the happiness of my whole
    life. I threw myself on my knees and, taking his hand,
    I kissed it. He embraced me and then he spoke to the
    others. He told them that he urged harmony among them.
    I thought he said that to me, and I answered that for that
    object as for all else I would obey him as long as I lived.
    He smiled and said: &ldquo;It is not for you that I said that; I
    know you do not need such urging; I said it for the other
    princesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>You can believe in what a state all this has put me. The
    king has shown a firmness beyond all expression; he gave
    his orders as if about to start on a journey. He said farewell
    to all his servants, and recommended them to my son,
    and made him regent, with a tenderness that penetrated the
    soul through and through. I think I shall be the next person
    in the royal family to follow the king if he dies; in the
    first place, on account of my advanced age, and next because
    as soon as the king is dead they are going to take the young
    king to Vincennes and we shall all go to Paris, where the air
    is so very bad for me. I shall have to stay there in mourning,
    deprived of fresh air and exercise, and, according to all
    appearance, I shall fall ill. It is not true that Mme. de
    Maintenon is dead. She is in perfect health in the king&rsquo;s
    chamber, which she never leaves either day or night.</p>
<p>If the king dies, and there is no means of doubting it, it
    will be to me a misfortune of which you can form no just
    idea; and that because of certain reasons which must not be
    written down. I see nothing before me but misery and
    wretchedness. Residence in Paris is intolerable to me.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig">September 6th.<br />
</p>
<p>It is long since I have written to you, but it was impossible
    I should do so. The king died Sunday last, at nine
    o&rsquo;clock in the morning. You can believe that I have had
    many visits to make and receive, and that I have received
    and written many letters. I am extremely troubled both by
    the loss of the king and by the fact that I must go and live
    in that cursèd Paris. If I spend a year there I shall be
    horribly ill; for that reason I want to quit it as soon as I can
    and go to Saint-Cloud. All this worries me much, but complaining
    does no good. I am very frank and very natural,
    and I say out all that I have in my heart. I must tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> that it is a great consolation to me to see the whole people,
    the troops and parliament rallying to my son and publicly
    proclaiming him regent. His enemies, who plotted round the
    death-bed of the king, are now disconcerted, and their cabal
    has lost ground. But my son takes these matters so much
    to heart that he has no rest either day or night; I fear he
    may fall ill, and many sad ideas come into my head, but I
    must not tell them.</p>
<p>My son has pronounced a speech in Parliament and they
    tell me he did not speak badly. The young king is very
    delicate; the ministers who governed under the late king
    keep their places, and as there is no doubt that they are
    quite as curious as they ever were, letters will continue to
    be opened. It is quite impossible that I should keep my
    health in Paris, for what preserved it was fresh air and
    exercise, hunting, and walking. But I ought to learn to
    resign myself to the will of God; the frightful wickedness
    and falseness of this world disgust me with life; I cannot
    hope to make the people love me&mdash;I am called to sit
    down to table, so I cannot read over my letter; excuse its
    faults.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, September 10th, 1715.<br />
</p>
<p>Here we are in this sad town. Last night I spent in
    weeping, and have given myself a bad headache. My son
    has given me a new apartment which is, beyond comparison,
    much superior to the old one; but I am always uncomfortable
    here. This morning I began to write, but could only
    accomplish a few lines, I have such a fearful crowd of people
    about me, and my head aches so that I know not what I
    write or what I do. Yesterday they took the late king to
    Saint-Denis. The royal household is dispersed; the young
    king was taken yesterday to Vincennes; Mme. de Berry
    went to Saint-Cloud; my son&rsquo;s wife and I came here; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> my son came too, after accompanying the king to Vincennes;
    I don&rsquo;t know where the others have gone.</p>
<p>I am not surprised, my dear Louise, that the king&rsquo;s death
    touched your heart; but what I wrote you was nothing to
    what we saw and heard. The king, of himself, was kind
    and just. But the old woman ruled him so completely that
    he did nothing except by her will and that of the ministers;
    he had no confidence in any but her and his confessor; and
    as the good king was very little educated, the Jesuits and
    the old woman on one side, and the ministers on the other,
    made him, between them, do exactly as they pleased,&mdash;the
    ministers being, for the most part, creatures of the
    old <i>vilaine</i>. So I can say with truth that all the evil
    that was done was not the king&rsquo;s own act; he was misled
    and imposed upon.</p>
<p>Yesterday they took the young king to parliament for
    his first <i>lit de justice</i>. The regency of my son was enregistered;
    so now it is a sure and certain thing.</p>
<p>I know that my son wants me to find pleasure in living
    here; but it is not in his power to make it so. I wish I
    could have a fever; for I have promised not to leave Paris
    unless I am ill, and headaches, which I am sure to have as
    long as I am here, will not count; but as soon as I have a
    fever I can return to my dear Saint-Cloud. My son has
    many other things to do than to think of my pleasures and
    conveniences. He greatly needs that we should pray to
    God for him; he seems to me resolved to follow the king&rsquo;s
    last orders and live in amity with his relations. I think
    that anything he directs himself will go well; but many
    things must, necessarily, escape his direction. To show that
    he does not wish to govern without other law than his own
    caprice, he has already created various councils,&mdash;one for
    civil affairs, one for ecclesiastical matters; there is also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> council for foreign affairs, and for war. He can do nothing
    but what has already been decided upon in those councils;
    it is difficult to believe that the council on ecclesiastical
    matters, which is composed of priests, will be favourable to
    the Reformers. I am quite determined not to meddle in
    anything. France has too long, to its sorrow, been governed
    by women; I will not, so far as concerns me, give a handle
    to any one to lay that blame on my son; and I hope that
    my example may open his eyes, and that he will not allow
    himself to be ruled by any woman.</p>
<p>Saint-Cloud is to me a spot of enchantment; and with
    good reason, for there is not in the world a more delightful
    residence. But if I had gone there, as I wished, all
    Paris would have detested me, and out of consideration for
    my son, I was bound to abstain from going. Do not think,
    dear Louise, that the king&rsquo;s death has rendered me, as I
    desired, freer in my actions; we are forced to live according
    to the customs of the country, and are in no wise masters of
    our own conduct. In my situation, one is truly the victim
    of greatness, and one must be resigned to do that for which
    we have no inclination. Do not be grateful to me for writing
    to you in the midst of my troubles; nothing soothes the
    heart so much as to tell our griefs to those we love, who
    give to our afflictions a real sympathy.</p>
<p>It is true that everybody thought the king dead when
    Mme. de Maintenon left him; but he had only lost consciousness
    for a time, and afterwards recovered it. I do
    not want to say anything more about these sad matters,
    which affect me cruelly. The king showed the greatest firmness
    up to his last moment. He said to Mme. de Maintenon,
    smiling: &ldquo;I have always heard it said that it was difficult
    to die; I assure you that I find it very easy.&rdquo; He remained
    twenty-four hours without speaking to any one; but during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> that time he prayed and repeated constantly: &ldquo;My God,
    have pity upon me; Lord, I am waiting to appear before
    you; why do you not take me, my God?&rdquo; He then repeated
    with much fervour the Lord&rsquo;s prayer and the Creed, and he
    died recommending his soul to God.</p>

</p>
<p>Parliament has recognized my son&rsquo;s rights to the regency,
    rights which his birth bestowed upon him indisputably.
    The king had told him he had made a will in which he
    would find nothing to complain of; and yet that will is
    found to be wholly in favour of the Duc du Maine; it is not
    therefore difficult to divine who dictated it&mdash;but do not let
    us talk of it.</p>
<p>My son has too often heard me speak of you not to know
    you and appreciate you, and he bids me offer you his affectionate
    compliments. The duties with which he is charged are
    far from easy; he finds everything left in a very miserable
    state; time is necessary to repair the situation; nothing
    presents itself that is not care and trouble, and for my son,
    as for me, the future does not appear under flattering colours.
    More than forty placards attacking him have been posted
    in Paris, and the dukes and peers are caballing against him
    in Parliament; but my son is so beloved by the people and
    the troops that his enemies are having their trouble for their
    pains, and all they get is the shame of it. I admit, however,
    that I am very uneasy in seeing him the target of so much
    animosity.</p>
<p>Ah! my dear Louise, you do not know this country. They
    laud my son to the skies, but only for the purpose, each
    man for himself, of getting some profit from it; fifty persons
    want the same office, and as it can only be given to one,
    forty-nine malcontents are made, who become rabid enemies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> My son works so hard from six in the morning till midnight
    that I fear his health will suffer.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig">October, 1715.<br />
</p>
<p>I have been to Saint-Cloud while the Duchesse de Berry
    came here. Between ourselves, I wish to have nothing to
    do with her; we do not sympathize. I live politely with
    her, as I would with a stranger, but I do not see her often,
    and I will not concern myself with anything that she does,
    or that her mother and her sisters do; I busy myself about
    my own affairs. The Court is not what it is in Germany,
    and no longer what it was in the days of Monsieur, when
    we dined together, and all of us met every evening in the
    state salons. In these days we live apart; my son takes
    his meals alone; I the same; his wife the same; she is so
    lazy she is never able to resolve at a given moment to do
    the slightest thing; she lies on a sofa all day, and Mme. de
    Berry follows that example at the Luxembourg; so you see,
    my dear Louise, that there cannot be any Court. Ah! you
    do not know the French; as long as they hope to obtain
    what they want they are charming; but out of fifty aspirants,
    forty-nine enemies are made, who cabal and play the
    devil. I know the Court and State too well to rejoice for a
    moment that my son is regent.</p>
<p>I have kept the word I gave you, and have earnestly entreated
    for the poor Reformers who are at the galleys; I
    have obtained a promise&mdash;but just now <i>No</i> is said to none.
    I do not know what my son may have said to Lord Stair
    about the Reformers, but I can assure you that when I spoke
    to him he gave me good hope, saying at the same time that
    there were very strong reasons which prevented him from
    doing the thing promptly.</p>
<p>In the days of Cardinal Mazarin they wrote horrible books
    against him. He appeared much irritated, and sent for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> the copies as if he intended to burn them up. When he had
    got them all he sold them secretly and made ten thousand
    crowns out of them. Then he laughed and said: &ldquo;The
    French are pretty fellows; as long as I let them sing and
    write, they will let me do just as I choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon is at Saint-Cyr, in the institution
    which she founded herself. She was never the king&rsquo;s mistress,
    but something much higher. She was governess to
    Mme. de Montespan&rsquo;s children, and from that she got a footing
    in salons, but she went much farther. The devil in hell
    cannot be worse than she has been; her ambition has flung
    all France into wretchedness. La Fontanges was a good
    girl; I knew her well; she was one of my maids-of-honour,
    handsome from head to foot, but she had no judgment.</p>
<p>I think that many people will declare themselves against
    King George, for the Chevalier de Saint-George has gone to
    Scotland. They told me to-night the details of his departure.
    He was at Commercy with the Prince de Vaudemont and
    was hunting a stag. After the hunt they sat at supper till
    midnight. On retiring to his chamber he said he was tired,
    and told his servants to let him sleep till he called them.
    Two hours after noon, as he gave no sign of life, his servants
    were frightened; entering his apartment and not finding him
    in his bed, they ran in terror with the news to the Prince de
    Vaudemont. The latter behaved as if he knew nothing, and
    said that a search must be made immediately. At the end
    of an hour the prince ordered all the portcullises raised, so
    that no one was able to leave the château for three days.
    During this time the chevalier reached Bretagne, and jumped
    into a fishing-boat which took him out to a Scotch vessel in
    which there were several lords, with whom he went to Scotland.
    If to-morrow I hear anything new about this, and do
    not die in the course of the night, I will tell you more.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>No one knows what will be the result of the affair, but I
    am pained for both rivals. King George is the son of my
    dear aunt, the electress, which makes him as dear to me as
    if he were my own child. On the other hand the Pretender
    is also my relation; he is the best man in the world; on all
    occasions he and the queen, his mother, have shown me the
    greatest friendship. I cannot wish harm to either the one or
    the other.</p>
<p>I ought to tell you that it would be sovereignly unjust on
    the part of Lord Stair to accuse my son of conniving in the
    flight of the Chevalier. How could he know what happened
    at Commercy, or guess that the Pretender was going incognito
    to Bretagne? My son did not know it for a week;
    when he heard it the affair was over. The Chevalier de
    Saint-George is the best and most polite man in the world.
    He asked Lord Douglas: &ldquo;What can I do to win the sympathy
    of my people?&rdquo; Douglas answered: &ldquo;Embark, take
    a dozen Jesuits with you, and as soon as you arrive, hang
    them publicly; nothing will please the people like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Leibnitz, to whom I sometimes write, assures me that
    I do not write German badly; this has given me great pleasure,
    for I should not like to forget my mother tongue.</p>
<p>The third daughter of Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans, Louise-Adélaïde, is
    well brought up and is not ugly. She firmly persists in being
    a nun; but I think she has no vocation for it. I do my
    best to turn her from the notion; but she has always had
    this folly in her head. She has very pretty hands and a
    skin that is naturally white and pink.</p>
<p>Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans has had six daughters. The first died
    when she was two years old; the second is the Duchesse de
    Berry; the third is seventeen, they call her Mlle. de Chartres,
    and it is she who wants to be a nun; she is the prettiest of
    them all both in face and figure; the fourth is Charlotte-Aglaé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> Mlle. de Valois; she will be fifteen in October. Then
    comes the Duc de Chartres, who is twelve in August. The
    fifth girl, Louise-Élisabeth, Mlle. de Montpensier, who is in a
    convent at Beauvais, was six on the eleventh of this month;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and finally Mlle. de Beaujolais, who is only a year old; Mme.
    d&rsquo;Orléans is again pregnant. No one ever thought of marrying
    Mlle. de Chartres to the Chevalier de Saint-George; it
    is true that it was rumoured about, but the persons whom it
    concerned never thought of it.</p>
<p>Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans is not of my opinion as regards her daughters;
    she would like to have them all nuns. She is not
    stupid enough to fancy that that would take them to heaven;
    but she desires it from pure laziness; for she is the laziest
    woman in the world, and she is afraid, if she has them near
    her, of the trouble of bringing them up. So she does not
    trouble herself about them; she lets them quarrel and do
    what they like. All that is without my approbation; and
    they must get out of it as they can. I am convinced that
    Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans&rsquo; ailments and weaknesses come from the
    fact that she is always in bed or on a sofa; she eats and
    drinks lying down. It is pure indolence in her. That is
    why we cannot take our meals together. She has not spoken
    to me since the death of the king.</p>
<p>Mme. de Berry is red. When she wishes to please she
    ought to talk, for she has natural eloquence. She keeps
    around her those who constantly deceive her. I say nothing
    to her now; she has intelligence, but has been very ill
    brought up. I no longer consider her as one of my grandchildren;
    she goes her way, and I go mine; I do not concern
    myself with her, nor she with me.</p>

</p>
<p>There never were two brothers so different as the late
    king and Monsieur; and yet they loved each other much.
    The king was tall with fair hair, or rather a light-brown;
    he had a manly air and an extremely fine face. Monsieur
    was not disagreeable in appearance, but he was very small,
    his hair was black as jet, the eyebrows thick and brown,
    with large dark eyes, a very long and rather narrow face,
    a big nose, a very small mouth, and shocking teeth; he had
    the manners of a woman rather than those of a man; he
    did not like either horses or hunting; he cared for nothing
    but cards, holding a court, good eating, dancing, and dressing
    himself; in a word, he took pleasure in all that women
    like. The king loved hunting, music, the theatre; Monsieur
    liked nothing but great assemblies and masked balls; the
    king liked gallantry with women; but I do not believe that
    in all his life Monsieur was ever in love. He was so fond of
    the sound of bells that he always went to Paris to spend All
    Saints night expressly to hear them ring as they do there the
    livelong night. He laughed about it himself, but declared
    that ringing gave him the greatest pleasure. I never let him
    go anywhere alone, except by his express orders. Monsieur
    was very devout; but he was brave. The soldiers in the
    army used to say of him: &ldquo;He is more afraid of sun and
    dust than he is of guns,&rdquo; and that was very true. The
    Chevalier de Lorraine was a wicked man, but the rest of
    his dear friends were no better. Some years before the
    late Monsieur&rsquo;s death he begged my forgiveness.</p>
<p>My son has studied much, he has a good memory, he
    seizes everything with facility. He does not resemble either
    his father or his mother. Monsieur had a long, narrow face,
    whereas my son has a square one. His walk is like that of
    Monsieur, and he makes the same motions with his hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> Monsieur had a very small mouth and villanous teeth; my
    son has a large mouth and beautiful teeth. He is too
    prejudiced in favour of his own nation. Though he sees
    every day how false and deceitful his compatriots are, he
    firmly believes there are no people on earth to be compared
    with the French.</p>
<p>I assure you that everything passed in all honour between
    my son and the Queen of Spain. I do not know whether
    he had the good fortune to please the queen, but he never
    was in love with her. He says she has a good expression,
    and a fine figure, but that neither her features nor her
    manners are to his taste. I certainly cannot deny that he
    is a lover of women; but he has his caprices, and everybody
    does not please him. The grand style suits him less than
    the dissipated, loose ways of the opera-dancers. I often
    ridicule him for it.</p>
<p>Our little king is now in the Tuileries in perfect health;
    he has never been really ill; he is very lively, and does not
    keep in one position for a single instant. To tell you the
    truth, he is very badly brought up; they let him do just
    what he likes for fear of making him ill. I am convinced
    that if they corrected him he would be less quick-tempered;
    and they do him great harm by letting him follow his
    caprices. But everybody wants to gain the good graces of
    a king, no matter how young he is.</p>
<p>Mme. la Duchesse learned from her mother and her aunt
    [Mmes. de Montespan and de Thiange] to turn people into
    ridicule; they never did anything else; everybody was a
    butt for their satire under pretext of amusing the king.
    The children, who were always there, never knew or heard
    aught else. It was a bad school, but not so dangerous as
    that of the children&rsquo;s governess; for the latter went seriously
    to work, without any intention of amusing, and told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> king all sorts of evil of everybody, under pretence of religion
    and charity and reforming the neighbour. In this way the
    king was given a bad opinion of the whole Court, and the
    old woman was able to prevent the king from liking to be
    with any others than herself and her creatures&mdash;they were
    the only perfect beings, exempt from all faults. This was
    really the more perilous because <i>lettres de cachet</i> sending
    persons to prison or exile, followed on such denunciations,&mdash;things
    which Mme. de Montespan never procured. When
    she had well laughed at any one she was satisfied and went
    no further.</p>
<p>Mme. la Duchesse has three charming daughters; one of
    them, Mlle. de Clermont, is very beautiful, but I think her
    sister, the young Princesse de Conti, is much more agreeable.
    The mother is not more beautiful than her daughters, but
    she has more grace, a better countenance, and more engaging
    ways; wit sparkles in her eyes, also malice. I always say
    she is like a pretty cat which lets you feel her claws even
    while she plays. She laughs at everybody; but is very
    amusing, and turns things into ridicule in such a pleasant
    way that you can&rsquo;t help laughing. She is very good company,&mdash;always
    gay, and makes the liveliest sallies; she is
    very insinuating, and when she wants to please a person
    she can take all shapes; in her life she never was out of
    temper, and if she is false (as she really is) there never was
    any one more agreeable; she knows how to adapt herself
    to every one&rsquo;s humour, and you would think she had a
    genuine sympathy for those to whom she shows it, but you
    must not trust her.</p>

<p>Cardinal de Noailles is certainly a virtuous cardinal of
    great merit, which all cardinals are not. We have four
    here, each different. Three have this in common, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> are all as false as gibbet-wood, but in face and temper they
    are quite different. Cardinal de Polignac is well-bred;
    he has capacity; he is insinuating, his voice is soft; he is
    too much given to politics and sycophancy, which makes
    him commit the faults for which people blame him. Cardinal
    de Rohan has a fine face, like his mother [Mme. de
    Soubise, one of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s mistresses], but he has no
    figure; he is vain as a peacock, full of whims, intriguing,
    a slave to the Jesuits; he thinks he governs everything, but
    really governs nothing; he believes that he is without an
    equal in this world. Cardinal de Bissy is ugly; he has
    the face of a clumsy peasant; he is proud, malignant, and
    false; more dissimulating than any one imagines; a sickening
    flatterer, you see his falseness in his eyes; he has
    capacity, but uses it only to do harm. These three cardinals
    could put the Noailles in a sack and sell him without
    his knowing it, as the proverb says; they are all three far
    more shrewd than he. Bissy and Tartuffe are as like as
    two drops of water; Bissy has just Tartuffe&rsquo;s manners.</p>
<p>Wolves are going about in bands of eight and ten and
    attacking travellers; the extreme severity of the cold is the
    reason of this; it is causing great misfortunes. In Paris
    eight poor washerwomen were at work on a boat; the ice
    cut the rope like a razor; the boat was crushed into bits;
    one of the women had the presence of mind to jump from
    one cake of ice to another, and they had time to throw her
    a rope and save her; but all the others perished. The head
    of one was cut off by the ice, and the body of another was
    cut through; that was an awful thing, and what made it
    more terrible was that the woman was pregnant, and when
    the ice cut her open the head of a child appeared. What can
    be imagined more dreadful than that!</p>

<p>I had completely won my husband during the last three
    years of his life; I had brought him round to laugh with me
    at his weaknesses, and to take what I said pleasantly without
    being irritated. He no longer allowed any one to calumniate
    and attack me in his presence; he had a just confidence
    in me; he always took my part. But previously to that I
    had suffered horribly. I was just about to become happy
    when our Lord God took away my poor husband, and I saw
    disappear in one instant the result of all the cares and pains
    I had taken for thirty years to make myself happy. I am
    subject to attacks of the spleen, and when anything agitates
    me my left side swells up as big as a child&rsquo;s head. I do
    not like to stay in bed; as soon as I wake I want to be up.</p>
<p>Three or four years before Monsieur&rsquo;s death I had, to
    please him, been reconciled with the Chevalier de Lorraine;
    after which he did me no more harm. The chevalier died so
    poor that his friends had to pay for his burial. He had,
    however, an income of three hundred thousand crowns; but
    he was a bad manager, and his people robbed him. As long
    as they gave him a thousand pistoles for his gambling and
    debauchery he let them dissipate and pillage his property as
    they chose. La Grançay contrived to get a great deal of
    money out of him. He came to a dreadful end. He was
    sitting with Mme. de Maré, sister of Mme. de Grançay, and
    was telling her how he had passed the night in debauchery,
    relating the utmost horrors, when he was struck with
    apoplexy, lost his speech at once, and never recovered consciousness.</p>
<p>If I could have given my blood to prevent the marriage
    of my son I would have done it; but after the thing
    was done I consulted only concord. Monsieur felt much
    attachment to his daughter-in-law during the first months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> but after he imagined that she looked with too favourable an
    eye on the Chevalier de Roye [Marquis de la Rochefoucauld]
    he hated her like the devil. To prevent him from bursting
    out I was obliged to represent to him daily with all my
    strength that he would dishonour himself, and his son too,
    by making a scene, which would lead to nothing but unhappiness
    with the king. As no one had wished for that
    marriage less than I, my advice was not suspicious; it was
    plain I spoke, not from attachment to my daughter-in-law,
    but for the purpose of avoiding scandal and from love of my
    son and his family. So long as an outburst could be prevented
    the thing was at least doubtful to the eyes of the
    public; an opposite behaviour would have given proof that
    it was true.</p>
<p>I am now satisfied with Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans; she shows me
    great respect, and I, too, do my best to please her in everything,
    and I live with her now as politely as possible. She
    never could resolve to dine with the king, her father, therefore
    she cannot take that pains for me. She is always lying
    down when she eats, with a little table and her favourite,
    the Duchesse Sforza, beside her. At mid-day my son is
    always with her.</p>

</p>
<p>There is nothing surprising in the fact that the dauphin
    [the Duc de Bourgogne] was in love with the dauphine. She
    had much intelligence and was very agreeable when she
    chose to be. Her husband was devout and rather melancholy
    in temperament, while she was always gay; that served to
    animate him and disperse his gloom; and as he had a strong
    liking for women (humpbacked persons always have), but
    was so pious that he thought he committed a sin by looking
    at any other woman than his wife, it is very simple that
    he was much in love with her. I have seen him squint to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> make himself ugly when a lady told him he had fine eyes;
    though it was not necessary, for the good soul was ugly
    enough without endeavouring to make himself more so. He
    had a shocking mouth, a sickly skin, was very short, humpbacked,
    and deformed. His wife lived very well with him,
    but she did not love him; she saw him as others did; and
    yet I think she was touched by the passion he had for her;
    it is certain that no greater attachment could be than that
    of the dauphin for his wife. He had many good qualities;
    he was very charitable and helped great numbers of officers,
    though no one knew it. At his birth the public rejoicings
    were universal. The dauphine could make him believe
    whatever she liked; he was so in love with her that whenever
    she looked favourably at him he went into ecstasy and
    was quite beside himself. When the king scolded him he
    seemed so distressed that the king was obliged to soften
    down. The old aunt [Mme. de Maintenon] would also
    seem so troubled that the king had enough to do to tranquillize
    her. In short, to get peace the king at last left the
    old mistress to direct all such domestic matters, and no
    longer concerned himself about them.</p>
<p>Nangis, who commanded the king&rsquo;s regiment, was not displeasing
    to the dauphine, but he had more liking for the
    little La Vrillière. The dauphin was fond of Nangis, and
    thought it was to please him that his wife talked to Nangis;
    he was convinced that his favourite had gallant relations
    with Mme. de La Vrillière.</p>
<p>My son is no longer a young man of twenty; he is forty-two,
    and therefore they cannot pardon him in Paris for running
    after women like a hare-brained youth when he has
    all the weighty affairs of the kingdom on his hands. When
    the late king took possession of his crown the kingdom was
    in a state of prosperity, and he could then very well divert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> himself; but to-day it is not the same thing; my son must
    work night and day to repair what the king, or rather, his
    faithless ministers, ruined.</p>
<p>I cannot deny that my son has a great inclination for
    women; he has now a sultana-queen, named Mme. de
    Parabère. Her mother, Mme. de la Vieuville, was lady of
    the bed-chamber to the Duchesse de Berry, and that is
    where he made her acquaintance. She is now a widow,
    with a fine figure, tall and well-made; her skin is dark and
    she does not paint; she has a pretty mouth, and pretty eyes,
    but very little mind; she is a fine bit of flesh. My son has
    become alarmingly delicate; he cannot kneel down without
    dropping over from weakness. When he drinks too much
    he does not use strong liquors, only champagne; he does
    not care for any other wine.</p>

<p>Cardinal de Richelieu, in spite of all his talent, used to
    have fits of madness; he fancied sometimes he was a horse,
    and would gallop round a billiard-table, neighing, and making
    a great noise for a hour, and trying to kick his attendants.
    After that they would put him to bed and cover him
    up to induce perspiration, and when he woke up he had no
    recollection of what had happened.</p>
<p>The late king used to say: &ldquo;I own I am piqued when I
    see that with all my authority as king over this country, I
    have complained in vain against those tall head-dresses; for
    not one person has shown the least desire to please me by
    lowering them. And yet a stranger arrives, an English
    nobody, with a flat cap, and suddenly all the princesses
    have gone from one extreme to the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans looks older than she is, for she puts on a
    great deal of rouge, and her cheeks and nose are pendent;
    moreover the small-pox has left her with a trembling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> head like that of an old woman. She is so indolent she
    expects to have larks drop roasted into her mouth, but
    as we do not live in a land where things are to be had
    for the asking, that is past wishing for. She would like
    very well to govern; but she does not understand true
    dignity, she is too badly bred for that; she knows how
    to live as a simple duchess but not as a grand-daughter
    of France.</p>
<p>My son&rsquo;s intentions are always good and upright; if some
    things happen that ought not to be, they are certain to be
    the doing of some one else. He is too easy and is not
    sufficiently distrustful; consequently he is often deceived;
    for wicked people know his kindness and abuse it shamefully.
    It is a fact that my son has enough education to keep him
    from ever being bored; he knows music well, and composes,
    not badly; he paints very prettily; he understands several
    languages, and he likes to read; he is well-informed about
    chemistry and comprehends without trouble very difficult
    sciences. And yet, all that does not keep him from being
    bored by everything. I have reason myself to be satisfied
    with him. He lives very well with me and gives me no
    ground to complain of him. He pays me much attention,
    and I know few persons in whom he has more confidence
    than he has in me.</p>
<p>In early days they always called me sister-pacificator,
    because I did my best to keep the peace between Monsieur
    and his cousin la Grande Mademoiselle, and also her sister,
    the Grand-duchess of Tuscany. They quarrelled often, and
    like children, for the merest nonsense. Monsieur was very
    jealous of his children; he kept them as much as he could
    away from me; he let me have more authority over my
    daughter and the Queen of Sicily than over my son; but
    he could not prevent me from telling him plain truths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> My daughter never in her life did anything to cause me
    uneasiness.</p>
<p>Monsieur did not like hunting. He never could bring
    himself to mount a horse&mdash;except at the wars. He wrote
    so badly that he frequently brought me the letters he had
    written to get me to read them to him, saying with a laugh,
    &ldquo;You are so accustomed to my writing, madame, do read
    that to me, for I don&rsquo;t know what I said.&rdquo; We often
    laughed over this with all our hearts.</p>
<p>The Duc du Maine thought he could have married my
    daughter, but certain merchants who were in Mme. de
    Montespan&rsquo;s apartment overheard her speaking to Mme. de
    Maintenon of the marriage,&mdash;those ladies thinking such
    common persons would not understand them. But the
    merchants spoke up and said, &ldquo;Mesdames, don&rsquo;t try that; it
    will cost you your lives if you make that marriage.&rdquo; That
    prevented the thing; for Mme. de Montespan was so frightened
    she went to the king and begged him not to think of
    it any longer.</p>
<p>The King of Denmark, Frederick IV., seems to me rather
    a fool; he wants to pass himself off as being in love with
    my daughter; in dancing he presses her hand and rolls his
    eyes up to heaven; he began a minuet at one end of the
    hall and ought to have ended it at the other, but he stopped
    in the middle to be told what to do. That distressed me
    for him; so I rose, took him by the hand, and led him back
    to his place; I think without that he would be still in the
    same spot. The good soul does not know what is and what
    is not the thing to do.</p>
<p>The Pretender has been well received in Scotland and
    proclaimed king; but I cannot tell you more, for we have
    very little news from England. The Queen of England is so
    happy in hearing of her son&rsquo;s safe arrival and good reception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> The poor woman is not accustomed to rejoice; her satisfaction
    has been so great that a fever which she had
    has passed off. I know from a good source that the pope
    and the King of Spain furnished the money for the Pretender.
    The pope gave thirty thousand crowns, and the
    king three hundred thousand; as for my son, he did not
    give a penny.</p>
<p>Religion used to be very reasonable in France before
    the old <i>guenipe</i> reigned here; but she ruined everything
    and introduced all sorts of silly devotions,&mdash;rosaries and
    such-like. If any persons wanted to reason upon that
    matter she and the confessor sent them to prison or exiled
    them. Those two caused all the persecutions that were
    levelled in France against the poor Reformers and Lutherans.
    That Jesuit with the long ears, Père La Chaise,
    began the work in union with the old <i>guenipe</i>, and Père
    Tellier finished it; it was thus that France has been
    utterly ruined.</p>
<p>The old woman was implacable, and when she had once
    taken a dislike to any one it was for life, and that person
    became the object of a secret persecution that never ceased.
    I experienced this; she laid many traps for me, which I
    escaped by the help of God. She was dreadfully weary of
    her old husband, who was always in her room. Some persons
    assert that she poisoned Mansard; they say she discovered
    that Mansard intended that very day to show certain
    papers to the king which would prove how she had made
    money from the post without the king&rsquo;s knowledge. Never
    in his life did the king hear of this adventure, nor of that
    of Louvois, because no one was inclined to be poisoned&mdash;that
    kept all tongues respectful.</p>
<p>Long before his death the king was entirely converted
    and no longer ran after women; when he was young the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> women ran after him; but he renounced all that sort of life
    when he imagined that he became devout. The real truth
    was that the old witch watched him so closely he dared not
    look at a woman; she disgusted him with society, to have
    him and govern him alone, and this under pretence of taking
    care of his soul. She controlled him so well that he even
    exiled the Duchesse de la Ferté who posed as being in love
    with him. When that duchess could not see him she had his
    portrait in her carriage, in order to look at him constantly.
    The king said she made him ridiculous, and sent her an
    order to go and live on her estates. It was suspected, however,
    that the Duchesse de Roquelaire, of the family of Laval,
    had made a conquest of the king; certainly his Majesty was
    not angry about her as he was with the Duchesse de la
    Ferté. Gossip had a great deal to say about this intrigue,
    but I never put my nose into it.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1716.<br />
</p>
<p>A Frenchman, a refugee in Holland, used to write to me
    how the affairs of the Prince of Orange were going. I
    thought that I should do the king a service in communicating
    to him what I thus heard; I did so. The king was
    much obliged and thanked me; but in the evening he said,
    laughing: &ldquo;My ministers insist that you are ill-informed;
    they say there is not a word of truth in what was written to
    you.&rdquo; I answered: &ldquo;Time will show who is best informed,
    your ministers, or the person who wrote to me; my intentions
    were good, monsieur.&rdquo; Some time later, after it
    was proved that King William had gone to England, M. de
    Torcy came to me and said that I ought to inform him of
    the news I received. I replied: &ldquo;You assured the king that
    I received false news; on which I ordered that nothing more
    should be written to me; for I do not like to spread false
    reports.&rdquo; He laughed, as he usually did, and said: &ldquo;Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> news is always very good.&rdquo; To which I answered: &ldquo;A great
    and able minister must have surer news than I, for he knows
    all things.&rdquo; That evening the king said to me: &ldquo;You have
    been ridiculing my ministers.&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;I only returned
    them what they gave.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>III.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Letters of 1717-1718.</span></h3>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1717.</p>
<p>M. le dauphin [Monseigneur] never really loved or hated,
    but he was malicious; his greatest pleasure was in giving
    pain; when he had a trick to play on any one he began by
    treating them graciously. In every respect he had the most
    inconceivable character that could be imagined. When
    one thought him angry he was often in the best humour;
    when he seemed content he was cross; never could we guess
    correctly. He had not heart enough to know what true
    friendship was; he loved only those persons who procured
    him amusement, and disliked all others. For over twenty
    years, as long as he was in the hands of the <i>grande</i> Princesse
    de Conti,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> I was on very good terms with him and he had
    great confidence in me; but after he passed into those of
    Mme. la Duchesse he completely changed. He behaved as
    if he had never seen or known me in his life, and as, after
    Monsieur&rsquo;s death, I never hunted with his Highness I had
    very few relations with him to his death. If he had had
    good sense he would have preferred the Princesse de Conti
    to Mme. la Duchesse, for she had a much better heart; she
    loved him unselfishly, whereas the other loved nothing in
    the world, and thought only of her pleasures, her interests,
    and her ambition. As long as she attained her ends she
    cared very little for the dauphin, who gave clear proof of his
    weak-mindedness by his dependence upon her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>When the King of Spain [his son, the Duc d&rsquo;Anjou] departed
    the king wept bitterly, and the dauphin too, but he
    had previously never given to any of his sons the slightest
    sign of attachment. He never had them in his apartments
    morning or evening; when he was not hunting he was always
    in those of the Princesse de Conti, or, later, in those of
    Mme. la Duchesse. No one would ever have guessed that
    the sons were his; he treated them as strangers and never
    called them &ldquo;my son,&rdquo; always &ldquo;M. le Duc de Bourgogne,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;M. le Duc d&rsquo;Anjou,&rdquo; &ldquo;M. le Duc de Berry;&rdquo; and they called
    him &ldquo;Monseigneur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lived very well with his wife for two or three years;
    that is to say, as long as the old woman was satisfied with
    the dauphine; but as soon as there came a little coolness
    between them she set herself to make the dauphin believe
    that his wife did not love him, that she cared only for
    Bessola [her maid], and that everybody thought him a fool
    for spending his time in a room where more German was
    talked than French. He was told also that Bessola was
    the confidante of the dauphine&rsquo;s gallantries, and helped her
    to make pleasure-parties with the maids-of-honour. I heard
    all these details from the dauphine herself [Marie-Anne-Victoire
    of Bavaria], for her husband, who still loved her,
    related them to her. But the old witch returned so often
    to the charge, and gave the dauphin so many opportunities,
    that he finally became enamoured of Mlle. de Rambure,
    afterwards Mme. de Polignac, and as soon as that amour
    began all his friendship for the dauphine departed.</p>
<p>At times the dauphine was not ugly, when, for instance,
    she had a fine colour. If she had not had such a passion
    for that faithless Bessola, she might perhaps have been
    happy. But that woman, in order to rule her and to maintain
    herself with the Maintenon, made the poor princess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> most wretched creature upon earth. She died tranquil and
    resigned, but they sent her into another world as surely
    as if they had put a pistol to her head. In giving birth
    to the Duc de Berry she was so badly managed that she
    became deformed; before that she had a very pretty figure.
    From that time she never had an hour&rsquo;s health. The
    evening before her death, while the little Duc de Berry was
    sitting on her bed, she said to him: &ldquo;My dear Berry, I
    love you much, but you have cost me dear.&rdquo; M. le dauphin
    was not affected. They had told him so much harm of his
    wife that he did not care for her, and when he muffled
    himself up in his great mourning-cloak he burst out laughing.
    The old <i>guenipe</i> hoped (as really happened) to govern
    the dauphin through his mistresses, which she could not
    have done had he continued to love his wife. That old
    woman had conceived such a terrible hatred to the poor
    princess, that I believe she had given orders to Clément,
    the <i>accoucheur</i>, to manage her ill. What confirms me in
    this idea is that she nearly killed the dauphine by going
    to see her in perfumed gloves; she afterwards said it was
    I who wore them, which was not true.</p>
<p>The dauphine often said to me: &ldquo;We are both unhappy,
    but the difference between us is that your Excellency endeavoured
    as much as you possibly could to avoid your fate;
    whereas I did my best to come here, and so I deserve what
    has happened to me.&rdquo; She loved the dauphin as a husband,
    but more as if he were her son. They tried to make
    her pass for crazy when she complained. An hour before
    her death she said to me: &ldquo;I shall prove to-day that I was
    not crazy when I complained and said that I was ill.&rdquo; The
    old <i>guenipe</i> sent her agents among the populace to spread
    a rumour that the dauphine hated France and wanted to
    create new taxes and lay burdens on the people.</p>

</p>
<p>Though the late Monsieur received much property with
    me, I was obliged to give it all up to him,&mdash;jewels, furniture,
    pictures, in short, all that came to me from my
    family; and I really had not means to live according to my
    rank and maintain my household, which is very considerable.
    I have been ill-used in this respect, but it was rather the
    fault of the Princess Palatine, who allowed my marriage-contract
    to be so ill-drawn. All the Madames have had
    pensions from the king; but as these are established on
    the old footing, they do not afford sufficient means to reach
    the end of the year. I have been obliged to cede my
    jewels to my son; otherwise I could not live as I should
    and keep up my establishment, which is very large; but
    to do so is, to my thinking, more commendable than to be
    decked with jewels.</p>
<p>I cannot see why people should have so many different
    garments. All I have are either full-dress gowns, or my
    hunting habit for horseback. I never in my life had a
    dressing-gown, and I have but one wrapper [<i>robe de nuit</i>]
    in my wardrobe to go to bed and get up in.</p>
<p>I was very glad when the late Monsieur, after the birth
    of his daughter, took a bed to himself, for I never liked the
    business of making children. When his Highness made me
    the proposal I said: &ldquo;Yes, with all my heart, Monsieur;
    I shall be very glad of it, provided you do not hate me and
    continue to be a little kind to me.&rdquo; He promised me that,
    and we were always very well satisfied with each other.</p>
<p>It was very annoying to sleep with Monsieur; he could
    not endure that any one should disturb his sleep; I was
    obliged to keep myself on the very edge of the bed, so that
    sometimes I fell out like a sack. I was therefore extremely
    pleased when Monsieur, in good friendship and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> bitterness, proposed that we should sleep in separate rooms.
    I am like you; I cannot imagine that any one should remarry;
    there is but one motive that I can conceive, and
    that is dying of hunger and getting one&rsquo;s bread that way.</p>
<p>I never had but one hundred louis for cards until the
    death of my mother; after Monsieur received the money
    of the Palatinate he doubled that allowance.</p>
<p>The Maréchale de Villars runs after the Comte de Toulouse;
    my son is also in her good graces, and he is not
    discreet. The Maréchal de Villars came to see me one day,
    and as he assumes to know much about medals he asked
    to see mine. Baudelot,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a very honourable and learned
    man, who is in charge of them, was obliged to show them.
    Baudelot is not the most discreet of men, and moreover
    he is little informed as to what goes on at Court. So he
    made a dissertation on one of my medals to prove, against
    the opinion of other savants, that a head with horns which
    appears upon it is that of Pan, and not that of Jupiter
    Ammon. To prove his erudition the worthy soul said to
    M. de Villars, &ldquo;Ah! monseigneur, here is one of the finest
    medals Madame has; it is the triumph of Cornificius; he
    has all sorts of horns. He was a great general like yourself,
    monseigneur; he has the horns of Juno and of Faunus.
    Cornificius, as you know, monseigneur, was a very able
    general.&rdquo; I interrupted him. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;if you
    stop to talk about each medal, you will not have time
    to show them all.&rdquo; But, full of his subject, he replied:
    &ldquo;Oh, Madame, this one is worth all the rest. Cornificius
    is really one of the rarest medals on earth. Consider it,
    Madame, look at it; here is a crowned Juno crowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> that great general.&rdquo; In spite of all I did, I could not
    prevent Baudelot from harping on horns to the marshal.
    &ldquo;Monseigneur knows all about such things,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
    I want him to judge whether I am not right in saying
    that those horns are the horns of Pan, and not of Jupiter
    Ammon.&rdquo; Everybody in the room had all they could do
    not to laugh. If it had been done on purpose it could not
    have been more complete. When the marshal had gone,
    I laughed out; but I had the greatest difficulty in convincing
    Baudelot that he had blundered.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1717.<br />
</p>
<p>It is certain that the Comtesse de Soissons, Angélique-Cunégonde,
    daughter of François-Henri de Luxembourg, has
    much virtue and capacity, though, like all the world, she
    has defects. One may say of her indeed that she is a poor
    princess. Her husband, Louis-Henri, Comte de Soissons, is
    very ugly. If her children had been like their mother they
    would have been very handsome, for all her features are
    fine; eyes, mouth, and lines of the face could not be better;
    her nose is a little too large, and her skin not delicate. All
    her sons, except Prince Eugène, have not been worth much,
    and any one who resembles Eugène cannot be good-looking.
    When he was young he was not so very ugly; but he has
    grown ugly in growing old; he never had a fine countenance
    or the noble air; his eyes are not bad, but his nose spoils
    his face; his teeth are too large and protrude from his
    mouth; he is always dirty, and he wears greasy hair which
    he never curls. I think a good deal of Prince Eugène, for
    he is not selfish. He did a fine action: he left behind him
    here a great many debts; after he entered the service of
    the emperor and acquired a fortune he paid to the last
    farthing all that he owed, even to those who had no bill or
    written engagement with him and never dreamed of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> paid. Therefore it is impossible that a man who acted with
    such loyalty could have betrayed his master for money.
    The accusations of the traitor Nimtsch are lies and the
    work of that devil of an Alberoni. I see from the &ldquo;Gazette
    of Vienna&rdquo; which you sent me that Prince Eugène does not
    intend to let so horrible an accusation drop, but will pursue
    the Comte de Nimtsch to the death. That is right.</p>
<p>I thank you for the silver coin you send; it comes
    extremely <i>à propos</i>. I have also the Doctor Luther in
    gold and in silver. I am convinced that Luther would
    have done much better not to make a separate Church,
    but to have confined himself to opposing the abuses of the
    papacy; more good would have come from it.</p>
<p>To go back to what I was beginning to tell you on Wednesday&mdash;I
    assure you that my son has more enemies than
    friends. His brother-in-law [the Duc du Maine] and his
    wife are working with the greatest ardour to rouse the hatred
    of the populace against him. Mme. du Maine is circulating
    writings against him. The children of the Montespan come
    of a malignant race.</p>
<p>The little king has a pretty face and much judgment, but
    he is a spiteful child; he loves no one in the world but his
    governess, Mme. de Ventadour; he takes aversions to people
    without any cause, and likes to say the most wounding
    things to them. I am not in his good graces, but that does
    not trouble me; for when he is of an age to reign I shall
    not be in this world and dependent on his caprices. When
    I advise my son to be on his guard against all these wicked
    people, he only laughs and says: &ldquo;You know, Madame,
    that we cannot avoid what God has ordained for us throughout
    all time; therefore, if I am to perish I cannot avoid it;
    therefore I shall do only what is reasonable for my preservation,
    but nothing extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>[This is a favourable opportunity to reveal Madame&rsquo;s
    French spelling; the letter is in German, but she quotes
    her son in French, as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vous saves bien, Madame, qu&rsquo;on ne peust Evitter ce que
    Dieu vous a de tout temps destines; ainsi, sije le suis à
    perir, je ne Le pourris Evitter; ainsi je feres que ce qui est
    raisonnable pour ma Conservation, mais rien dextraordinaire.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>My son has studied much; he has a good memory; he
    expresses himself well on all sorts of subjects; above all,
    he speaks extremely well in public; but he is a man, he
    has his faults like others. They do harm to himself only,
    for he is only too kind and good to other people. I tell him
    every day he is too kind; he laughs and asks me if it is
    not better to be kind than harsh. I don&rsquo;t know where he
    gets his great patience; Monsieur had none, nor I either.</p>
<p>When he was fourteen or fifteen years of age he was not
    ugly; but since then the sun of Italy and Spain so burned
    him that his skin became a deep red. He is not tall, and
    yet he is stout, with fat cheeks; his bad sight makes him
    squint, and his eyes protrude; and he has a bad walk. And
    yet I do not think he is disagreeable-looking. When he
    dances or rides on horseback he makes a good appearance;
    but when he goes about in his usual way he does not appear
    to advantage. Close by he sees very well, and can read the
    finest writing, but at the distance of half the length of a
    room he recognizes no one without spectacles. Though he
    talks well on matters of science or knowledge, one can
    easily see that they give him no pleasure; on the contrary,
    they bore him. I have often observed this to him; he
    admits that at first he has the greatest desire to know a
    thing, but as soon as he thoroughly knows what he studies
    it gives him no longer the least satisfaction. I love him
    from the bottom of my heart, but I cannot understand how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> women should be enamoured of him; for he has in no way
    the manners of gallantry, and he is not discreet; besides,
    he is incapable of feeling a passion and of being attached
    for any length of time to the same person. On the other
    hand, his manners are not polite or seductive enough to
    make him beloved. He is very indiscreet and relates all
    that happens to him. I have told him a hundred times
    that I am amazed that those women run after him so
    madly when I should think they would rather run away
    from him. He laughs and says: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the
    loose women of the present day. To say you have been
    their lover pleases them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am very glad that my letters have reached you at last.
    M. de Torey is no friend of mine; if he could find occasion
    to do me harm he would not let it escape him; but I do not
    trouble myself about that. My son knows me well; he
    knows how sincere my attachment to him is, and it would
    be difficult to make us quarrel. There is no use in sealing
    letters with wax; they have a species of composition, made
    of quicksilver and other substances, which lifts the wax,
    and when the letters have been opened, read, and copied,
    they seal them up so adroitly that no one can perceive that
    they have been opened. My son knows how to manufacture
    that composition; they call it <i>gama</i>. The Queen of Sicily
    once wrote and asked me if I no longer walked with the
    king, as in her day. I answered with these lines:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquot"> &ldquo;Those happy days are gone; the face of all is changed<br />
    Since to these parts the gods have brought<br />
    The daughter of the Cretan king and Pasiphaë.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
<p>Torey took them to the <i>guenipe</i>, as if I meant her&mdash;which
    was true enough; and the king was sulky with me for a
    long time about it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>The late king contracted a great many debts because he
    would not retrench his luxury in anything; and that has
    been the cause of great malversations on the part of business
    men and their partisans; for when one sou had been
    lent to the king they turned it by agreement with their
    creatures into a pistole. Thanks to their rascality, on which
    no check was put, they have enriched themselves, but the
    king, and now the country, have been impoverished. My
    son works night and day, with no thanks from anybody,
    to bring things back to a good condition. He has many
    enemies, who pour out against him all sorts of horrid
    threats, and do all they can to rouse the hatred of the
    people against him; in which they succeed easily, especially
    because he is no bigot. He is so little self-interested that
    he has never touched a farthing of what comes to him as
    regent, although he has great needs because of his numerous
    children. The young king has around him persons who
    are very ill-disposed towards my son,&mdash;one especially, though
    he is his brother-in-law; but he is also the falsest of hypocrites.
    He has an air as if he would eat the very images
    of saints, but he is none the less the most wicked man on
    earth. In the days of the late king when that man flattered
    any one and spoke to him kindly it was taken as a proof
    that he had played him some evil trick. He contributed
    to get his mother sent away from Court so as to please the
    old woman, and he was so anxious to prevent her return to
    Versailles that he ordered her furniture turned out of doors,
    as it were. You can imagine what a man of that nature is
    capable of doing. I fear him for my son as I do the devil;
    and I think that my son is not sufficiently on his guard
    against him. The old woman wants his life; all that they
    say of that diabolical woman is below the truth.</p>
<p>When my son reproached the Maintenon quite gently for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> slandering him, and asked her to look into her conscience,
    where she knew that what she said were falsehoods, she
    replied: &ldquo;I spread that rumour because I believed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My
    son said: &ldquo;No, you could not have believed it, for you knew
    the contrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon she answered insolently (and I
    admired the patience of my son): &ldquo;Did not the dauphine
    die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could she not have died without me?&rdquo; asked my
    son, &ldquo;was she immortal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman replied: &ldquo;I was
    in such despair at her loss that I blamed the person who
    they told me had caused it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My son said to her, &ldquo;But,
    madame, you knew of the report that was rendered to the
    king; you knew that I had done nothing, and that Mme.
    la dauphine was not poisoned at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; she
    replied, &ldquo;I will say no more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That humpback Fagon, the favourite of the old <i>guenipe</i>,
    used to say that what displeased him in Christianity was
    that he could not raise a temple to the Maintenon and an
    altar for her worship.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1717.<br />
</p>
<p>I have received to-day a great visit,&mdash;that of my hero, the
    czar [Peter the Great]. I think he has very good manners,
    taking that expression in the sense of the manners
    of a person without affectation or ceremony. He has much
    judgment; he speaks bad German, but he makes himself
    understood without difficulty, and he converses very well.
    He is polite to everybody, and is much liked.</p>
<p>He went to Saint-Cyr and saw the old <i>guenipe</i>, who keeps
    herself completely retired there; no one can say that she
    has meddled in the slightest thing; which makes me think
    that woman has still some project in her head, though I
    can&rsquo;t imagine what it can be. She used to reproach me,
    and say it was a shame I had no ambition and never took
    part in anything, and one day I answered: &ldquo;If a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> had intrigued a great deal to become Madame, might she
    not be permitted to enjoy that title in tranquillity? Imagine
    that to be my case, and leave me in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;You
    are very obstinate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered: &ldquo;No, madame, but I like
    my peace and I regard your ambition as pure vanity.&rdquo; I
    really thought she would burst her skin, she was so angry.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;Make the attempt; you will be aided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,
    madame,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;when I think that you, who have a
    hundred-fold more cleverness than I, have not been able
    to maintain yourself at Court as you wished, what would
    happen to me, a poor foreigner, who knows nothing of
    intrigues and does not like them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was angry and
    said: &ldquo;Fie! you are good for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She never could forgive the king for not having declared
    her queen. She gave herself out to the King of England
    as so pious and humble that the queen took her for a saint.
    The old <i>guenipe</i> knew very well that I was a German who
    could never in my life endure a misalliance, and she
    imagined that it was partly because of me that the king
    would not acknowledge his marriage. The hatred she bore
    me came from that; as long as the queen lived she did
    not hate me. After the death of the king, and since we
    left Versailles, my son has not seen the old woman. The
    mistresses of the late king did not tarnish his glory as much
    as she did; she has drawn upon France the greatest misfortunes.
    She occasioned the persecution of the Reformers;
    she caused the price of wheat to rise, which brought a
    famine; she helped the ministers to rob the king; she was
    guilty of the death of the king in consequence of the worry
    she caused him about that Constitution [the bull Unigenitus];
    she made the marriage of my son, and tried to put
    the bastards on the throne. In short, she threw all things
    into confusion and ruined them. The ministers also served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> the king very ill. The king never thought that his will
    would be sustained. He said to several persons: &ldquo;They
    made me write my will and other things; I did it to get
    peace, but I know that all that will not stand hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1717.<br />
</p>
<p>I will tell you frankly why I will not interfere in anything.
    I am old; I need to rest, and do not care to torment
    myself. I am not willing to undertake anything that I cannot
    be sure of carrying through to a good end; I have never
    learned to govern; politics I do not understand, nor State
    affairs, and I am much too old now to learn such difficult
    things. My son, thanks to God, has capacity enough to
    guide things without me; besides, I should excite the
    jealousy of his wife, and his eldest daughter, whom he loves
    better than he does me; from this, perpetual quarrels would
    result, and that is something that would in no wise suit me.
    I have been much urged and tormented to use my influence,
    but I held firm. I said I wished to set a good example to
    the wife and daughter of my son. This kingdom has, to its
    sorrow, been too long governed by women, young and old.
    It is time to let men take the helm. I have therefore
    adopted the course of meddling in nothing. In England
    women can reign; but in France, in order to have things go
    well, men must govern. What advantage should I gain by
    tormenting myself night and day? I ask for only peace
    and rest. All my own nearest ones are dead; for whom,
    therefore, should I give myself cares? My life is nearly
    over; there remains to me only enough to prepare for a
    tranquil death, and it is difficult in great public matters to
    keep one&rsquo;s conscience peaceful.</p>
<p>I was born at Heidelberg, in September, 1652. When I
    can by my influence help those poor people of the Palatinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> in the councils which decide their affairs, I employ it with
    all my heart. If it succeeds I am very glad; if it fails I
    think it is the will of God, and I am still content.</p>
<p>The king had a better opinion of my brain than it
    deserves. He wanted with all his might to make me regent
    with my son. God be praised it was not done. I should
    have gone crazy very quickly.</p>
<p>I have never had Trench manners and I never could
    assume them; I have even made it a point of honour to be
    a German woman, and to preserve German manners and
    ways, which are little to the taste of people here. In the
    matter of soup, I never eat any but milk soup, or beer or
    wine soup; I cannot endure broths; I am made ill at once
    if there is the merest little broth in the dishes I eat; my
    body swells up, I have colics, and I am forced to be bled;
    blood puddings<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and ham settle my stomach.</p>
<p>The king used to say of me: &ldquo;Madame cannot endure
    misalliances; she is always mocking at them.&rdquo; But all the
    great ladies who contract such marriages are well rewarded;
    they are usually unhappy in wedlock and ill-treated by
    their husbands. That is the case of the Princesse de Deux-Ponts,
    who married her equerry. She finds herself very
    badly off, but I do not pity her; she deserves it. I can&rsquo;t
    help laughing when I think how I forewarned her of what
    would happen. She was with me at the opera and wanted
    with all her might to have that equerry sit behind us. I
    said, &ldquo;For the love of God, Madame, let your Highness keep
    quiet, and not worry yourself so about Gersdorf; you do not
    know this country; when people show such anxiety about
    their servants it is always supposed they are in love with
    them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot persons feel an interest in their people?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> she asked.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Yes; and they can take them to the
    opera, but there is no need to have them close beside us.&rdquo; I
    did not know then that I had guessed true.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1717.<br />
</p>
<p>For the last six months, in consequence of a terrible blow
    my son received in the face when playing tennis, one of his
    eyes is all inflamed and full of blood. He consulted an
    oculist who prescribed good remedies and made him promise,
    above all, to restrain himself in eating and drinking, etc.;
    but he cannot resolve to keep that promise and he leads his
    usual life. The condition of the eye has therefore grown much
    worse; my son has had recourse to all the remedies, but he
    will not interrupt his pleasures, or his business, which gives
    him a great deal of reading and writing to do. Yesterday,
    he let himself be bled and purged; to-day he is trying a
    powder which a priest gave him, having got it from Germany.
    This powder has begun by causing a great inflammation; he
    will have to use it two or three times. I really fear it will
    end in his losing his sight; and you cannot think into what
    anxiety that idea throws me.</p>
<p>To answer the other points in your letter, I must tell you
    that it is not allowable to take the communion in one&rsquo;s
    chamber, unless in case of illness. I should like very much
    to hear sermons in Advent; but after dinner it is impossible;
    for if I listen to preaching just after eating it does not depend
    on me not to go to sleep.</p>
<p>The Princess of Wales is, thank God, safely delivered of a
    son. It is quite common that pregnancies should be delayed,
    like hers, to the tenth month. As for me, I have had three
    children, but without anything extraordinary. I never had
    a miscarriage, and bore them all to the end of the ninth
    month. I lost my first son; my doctor, old M. Esprit, killed
    him as if he had shot him through the head; but all that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> ancient history. He was called the Duc de Valois; but as
    that name is unlucky, Monsieur would not let my second
    son bear it; that is why he received the name of Duc de
    Chartres, which he bore till the death of his father; then he
    took the name of Duc d&rsquo;Orléans, and his son is now the Duc
    de Chartres.</p>

</p>
<p>The moment I get an instant of liberty I go to the chapel
    to pray for my son, whose eye is rather better. He could
    not at one time distinguish colours; but Cardinal de Polignac
    came to see him to-day when I was with him, and my son
    could perfectly discern the cardinal&rsquo;s red robe; which proves
    him really better. As long as he was taking remedies he
    kept himself from excesses of eating and drinking and ill-conduct
    of every kind, but I fear that as soon as he is cured
    he will go back to his disorderly life. Those loose women
    will run after him again and get him back to their little suppers,
    and then his eye will inflame once more. After the visit
    to my son I sat down to table, and after dinner I read four
    chapters of the Book of Job, four psalms, and two chapters
    of Saint John. The two others I put off till this morning.</p>
<p>It is quite true, as you say, that my son&rsquo;s mistresses if they
    really loved him would think about his life and health; but
    I see, my dear Louise, that you know nothing about Frenchwomen.
    Nothing leads them except selfishness and a liking
    for debauchery; these mistresses think of nothing but their
    pleasure and money; for the individual himself they would
    not give a hair. That inspires me with utter disgust; and if
    I were in my son&rsquo;s place I should find nothing seductive in
    such connections. But he is so accustomed to them; it is
    all the same to him what those women are, provided they
    amuse him. There is also another thing I cannot comprehend.
    He is never jealous; he will let his own servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> have relations with his mistresses. That seems to me dreadful,
    and proves that he has no love for them. He is so
    accustomed to eat and drink and lead that debauched life
    that he cannot tear himself from it. It often afflicts me to
    the bottom of my heart; but I hope that God will in the end
    draw him through this labyrinth and wrench him from the
    hands of these wicked people, who are only wanting to get
    money from him. But that is saying enough about vexations.</p>
<p>The little king makes me two visits a year much against
    his will; he cannot endure me. I think that is because I
    told him once it did not become a great king to be so refractory
    and obstinate as he is. He was in despair one day
    because Mme. de Ventadour left him. She said: &ldquo;Sire, I
    shall return this evening; be very good during my absence.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;No, my dear mamma,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;not if you leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is well made and has the straightest figure that was
    ever seen and beautiful brown hair in abundance. His face
    is pretty, but he only speaks to those persons who habitually
    surround him. He has intelligence, that is very certain, but
    he ought to talk more. He has invented an Order which he
    gives to the boys who play with him; it is a blue and white
    ribbon, from which hangs an oval piece of enamelled metal,
    on which is a star and the outline of a little tent which
    stands on the terrace where he plays. He has eyes as black
    as jet, and what may be called a noble look; the eyes are
    much softer than he really is, for he has a violent little
    temper. His vanity is already dreadful, and he knows very
    well what reverence is.</p>

<p>The late king told me a story about the Queen of Sweden,
    Christina. She never wore night-caps, but she twisted a
    towel round her head. Once, not being able to sleep, she
    had music played beside her bed. As the concert pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> her she suddenly protruded her head beyond the curtains
    and called out, &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s death! how well they play!&rdquo; The
    eunuchs and Italians, who are not the bravest of the brave,
    were so terrified at the aspect of that singular figure that they
    were struck speechless, and the music had to stop. We can
    still see at Fontainebleau in the great salon the blood of the
    man she caused to be murdered there. She did not wish
    that all that he knew about her should come to be known,
    and she thought certain things would surely be divulged
    unless she put an end to his life. He had already begun to
    tattle, out of jealousy for another man who had supplanted
    him in her good graces. She was very vindictive and given
    to all sorts of debauchery. If she had not had so much
    intellect no one could have endured her. She owed her
    vices to Frenchmen, especially to old Bourdelot, who was
    the doctor of the great Condé; he encouraged her in her
    license. She talked of things that the worst men only could
    have imagined. She was considered to be an hermaphrodite.
    The Frenchmen who were with her in Stockholm were
    very depraved men, and it was they who led her into such
    licentiousness. Duke Frederick Augustus of Brunswick was
    charmed with Christina; he said that in all his life he had
    never met with any woman who had so much intellect and
    was so agreeable and diverting; he never found the time
    long when he was with her. I told him I heard that her
    talk was most licentious; he said that was true, but that
    she knew so well how to present things that they did not
    inspire disgust. This queen could never please women, because
    she despised them one and all.</p>

</p>
<p>My last letters from England are to the 16th of January;
    everything is in a sad state there. They say in Paris that
    the refugees are doing their best to excite the king and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> Prince of Wales against each other in the hope that a
    regent may be chosen by the parliament, and that the
    country will thus escape the authority of the prince. That
    seems very likely to be true; but it also seems to me that
    father and son ought to perceive the scheme and thus be
    led to reconciliation with each other; if not, great evils
    will result. There is no motive in the world which can
    justify a son in not submitting to a father, and when, moreover,
    that father is his king. I believe there has never
    existed any tenderness between them; our dear Electress
    used to say it was the son who was in fault. The dear
    Princess of Wales inspires me with such compassion that
    yesterday I wept over her. Her departure from Saint
    James&rsquo; palace as Countess of Buckenburg [<i>sic</i>] was described
    to me; it was truly deplorable; she fainted several
    times when her three little princes, all in tears, took leave
    of her; that touched me deeply. The King of England, if
    I may dare to say so, treats her too harshly. She has done
    nothing to justify his forbidding her to see her children,
    whom she loves with such tenderness. Where can they be
    better brought up than beside so sensible and virtuous a
    mother? According to my ideas, the whole thing is very
    blamable.</p>
<p>King George was always an artful, dissimulating egoist.
    I have known that for a long time. Whatever marks of
    friendship I gave him he never gave me any sign of confidence,
    and sometimes would scarcely speak to me. I had
    to drag his words from him, one by one, which is a very
    unpleasant thing to do; he is completely devoid of good
    natural feelings. I am not surprised that he takes no
    notice of you. He cares for no one; but it happens to him,
    as it does to such people, that in return nobody cares for
    him. He piques himself on not being civil; I saw this by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> the manners of those who frequented his Court in Hanover.
    It is not possible to meet any one more sulky and surly
    than young Count Platten; if he had not been warmly
    recommended to me by my aunt, and if his father and
    mother had not been my good friends, I would have let
    him be put in a place where he would have had time to
    make reflections and learn how to live; he fully deserved
    the Bastille, but serious reasons led me to save him.</p>

</p>
<p>My Lorraine children have arrived; my daughter was
    beside herself with an excess of joy. I do not find her
    much changed, but her husband is, dreadfully. He used to
    have a fine skin and now he has turned to a red-brown and
    he is stouter than my son. I can say now that my children
    are fatter than I.</p>
<p>My daughter is gay and content; but her husband seems
    preoccupied. Yesterday she had a strong attack of fever:
    God grant it may not be the forerunner of small-pox; for
    neither the Duc de Lorraine nor my son have had it, and
    the duke would not fail to be with his wife; three of his
    brothers have died of that terrible malady; therefore I am
    very anxious about this. I will write you more about it on
    Wednesday.</p>
<p>They told me yesterday that a nun has just died who
    was one hundred and thirty years old; she had a long old
    age; I don&rsquo;t envy it; if one could stay young it would be
    another thing and would make one&rsquo;s mouth water for it.</p>
<p>The poor Princess of Wales causes me real pain. In a
    letter of the 3rd of this month she tells me that her husband
    and she have three times asked pardon of the king as they
    would ask it of God, and could not obtain it. I cannot
    understand such a thing. I fear that the prince may be
    concerned in his mother&rsquo;s trouble. I have an idea that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> King of England believes he is not his son; for it does not
    seem possible that he should act with his own child as he
    has been acting. But, in any case, it appears to me that if
    he publicly recognizes him as his son he ought to treat him
    as a son, and not behave so rigorously to a princess who, in
    all her life, never did anything against him and has always
    honoured and loved him as a father. From what I see
    and know, I think no good will ever come of it; the irritation
    is too great. But the king had better put an end to
    the matter, for it leads to a hundred impertinent things
    being said, and renews certain old and villanous tales that
    had better be forgotten. May God guide all for the best!
    I have been told that a sort of petition has been sent to
    the Prince of Wales in which it was said that if he had any
    honour he would admit that the kingdom did not belong
    to him, but to the legitimate sovereign, now called The
    Pretender; who was the son of James II. as surely as he,
    the prince, was the son of Comte Königsmarck. It was
    terribly insolent.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>My Lorraine children leave me in three days; my heart
    is full; my daughter would gladly have stayed longer; but
    the duke was anxious to return. My daughter is, thank
    God, so firmly fixed in good principles that she can mix in
    all society without fear of contamination. But nothing was
    ever seen like the youth of the present day; it makes one&rsquo;s
    hair stand on end. I know a daughter who encourages the
    debauchery of her father; she is not ashamed to procure
    him a pretty waiting-maid, and her mother looks on and
    lets it be done, so that she may be left in peace [evidently
    the Duchesse de Berry]. In short, one sees and hears of
    nothing but shocking things. My daughter tells me that
    though I wrote them to her she could not believe me, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> she saw them daily with her own eyes. Youth no longer
    believes in God, and neglects all exercise of religion; consequently
    God abandons it. It is sad to live in a period
    when honest people have such surroundings; it inspires
    universal disgust. I thank God that my daughter knows
    what virtue is and has a righteous horror for the life that
    people are leading; that is a great comfort to me.</p>
<p>I hear that in Germany the princesses are beginning to
    go about and act as they do in France; it was not so in
    my day. The times have come, as Holy Scripture says,
    when seven women run after one man; never were women
    what they are at present; they act as if their only happiness
    was sleeping with men. What one sees and hears here
    daily, even about the most eminent personages, is not to be
    written down. When my daughter lived here it was not
    so; therefore she is in a state of astonishment that puts her
    sometimes beside herself and has more than once made me
    laugh. She cannot accustom herself to see, openly at the
    opera, women who bear the noblest names behave to men
    with a familiarity that indicates something very different
    from hatred. She says to me sometimes, &ldquo;Madame!
    Madame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answer: &ldquo;Well, my daughter, what can I do?
    those are the manners of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such manners are
    infamous,&rdquo; she replies, with truth. Never was the mercy of
    God needed as it is now, for this epoch of ours is terrible.
    One hears of nothing but quarrels, disputes, robberies, murders,
    and vices of all kinds; the old serpent, the devil, has shaken
    off his chains and reigns in the air. It behooves all good
    Christians to give themselves up to prayer.</p>
<p>The Princess of Wales writes me that the Countess of
    Shrewsbury [Madame spells the name Schoresburg] flung
    herself at the knees of the king to ask pardon for her brother,
    who is condemned to be hanged. The king replied that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> he granted that pardon he should rouse the anger of the
    English, who would say the guilty man was spared because
    he was a foreigner, whereas were he English he would be
    hanged without pity. He deserved severe punishment, but
    I pity his sister; it is a dreadful thing for nobles to hang
    on a gibbet. Things are going from bad to worse in England,
    and I dare write nothing more upon that subject. All
    Paris says that King George intends to declare publicly that
    the Prince of Wales is not his son, and, to injure him still
    further, that he means to marry the Schulenberg, now
    Duchess of Munster. I told this to Lord Stair; he answered
    that nothing of the kind would happen, and I need not
    trouble myself.</p>
<p>In England, and in France too, the dukes and lords have
    such excessive pride that they think themselves above everybody;
    and if allowed to have their way they would consider
    themselves superior to the princes of the blood; some of
    them are not really nobles. I rebuked one of our dukes
    very neatly one day. As he was placing himself at the
    king&rsquo;s table above the Prince de Deux Ponts I said, quite
    loud: &ldquo;How comes M. le Duc de Saint-Simon to be pressing
    up to the Prince de Deux Ponts? does he want him to take
    one of his sons as page?&rdquo; Everybody laughed so loud
    that he had to go away.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>Mme. de Berry has made my daughter a very pretty parting
    present; it is a commode, or rather a table with drawers,
    in which are all kinds of stuffs, scarfs, coiffures, etc., in the
    last fashion. The commode is decorated with gilt ornaments
    worth a thousand pistoles. My son gave his sister a <i>necessaire</i>,
    that is to say, a small square chest containing whatever
    is necessary for taking tea, coffee, and chocolate. The cups
    are in white porcelain with raised designs in gold and enamel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>My daughter has postponed her departure till Wednesday;
    the day will come soon enough, for whatever grieves us
    comes more surely and quickly than what gladdens us.
    The king owes a great deal of money to the Duc de Lorraine,
    and on account of that debt he has given him one hundred
    thousand francs to pay the costs of this journey.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales has done a fine action, and if that
    does not touch the King of England nothing will ever
    restore peace between them. Emissaries went to the prince
    and urged him to put himself at the head of their party.
    He answered that never in his life would he belong to any
    party against his father and king. The King of England
    is a bad man; he had no consideration for his mother, who
    loved him tenderly, and without whom he never would have
    been King of England. None of her children, even the
    Queen of Prussia, whom she adored, ever treated her as they
    ought.</p>
<p>My Lorraine children are satisfied with me, and I with
    them. I am also more satisfied with my grand-daughter
    the Duchesse de Berry, who behaved very well to them.
    She has good judgment and she shows a disposition to
    return to religion and a disgust for vice. I hope that God
    will have pity upon her and grant her the mercy of a sincere
    conversion. If she had been properly brought-up she would
    have turned to better things, for she has capacity, and a
    good heart; also she has, undoubtedly, intellect, and is never
    captious. I tease her sometimes, and tell her she only
    fancies she likes hunting; for at bottom it is only a liking
    for change of place. She really cares for nothing but the
    death of the game, and she prefers that of a boar to a stag,
    because it procures her good blood-puddings and sausages.
    She amuses herself as much as she can; one day she hunts,
    another she drives, on a third she goes to a fair; sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> to see the rope-dancers, or to the comedy or the opera; but
    always in a scarf, never in a gown with a body to it. She
    sometimes laughs about her figure and her waist. Her flesh
    is very firm, and her cheeks are as hard as stones.</p>
<p>I once made the Comtesse de Soissons laugh with all
    her heart when she asked me: &ldquo;How is it, Madame, that
    you never look at yourself when you pass a mirror, as
    other people do?&rdquo; I answered: &ldquo;Because I have too
    much vanity to like to see myself, ugly as I am.&rdquo; There
    cannot be in the whole world more villanous hands than
    mine. The late king often reproached me for them, and
    made me laugh heartily myself. As I never in my life
    could boast of having anything pretty about me, I took a
    way of laughing myself at my own ugliness; and that has
    answered, for indeed I have often found cause to laugh.</p>
<p>Mme. de Berry does not eat much at dinner, and it is impossible
    that she should, because she makes them bring her,
    before she gets up, all sorts of things to eat; she never stirs
    from her bed till mid-day; at two o&rsquo;clock she sits down to
    table, and does not leave it till three; she takes no exercise;
    at four they bring her eatables of all kinds, fruits, salad, and
    cheese; at ten she sups, and goes to bed between one and
    two o&rsquo;clock; she drinks the strongest brandy.</p>
<p>The youth of both sexes in France lead the most reprehensible
    life; the more licentious it is, the better they think
    it. That may be very nice, but I confess I do not think it
    is. They do not follow my example in having regular hours;
    but I am determined not to alter my conduct to suit theirs,
    which seems to me that of sows and hogs.</p>
<p>Nothing in the world disgusts me so much as the taking
    of snuff; it makes all noses horrible and spreads a fetid
    odour. I have known persons with sweet breath who in
    six months after they took to tobacco, smelt like goats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> With noses besmeared with snuff they look, forgive me the
    expression, as if they had tumbled into a cesspool. The
    king detested the habit, but his children and his grandchildren
    persisted in it, though they knew how he disliked
    it. Persons should abstain altogether, for if they take
    a little they soon want to take much. People call it the
    magic herb, because those who once begin to use it cannot
    go without it.</p>

</p>
<p>I received a letter yesterday from my daughter; she and
    her husband are, thank God, safely back at Lunéville in good
    health. She sends me the measure of the height of her
    eldest son, taken the week before he was eleven years old;
    he is just as tall as the Duc de Chartres, who will be fifteen
    next July. I am afraid my grandson Lorraine is going to
    be a giant, for the Duc de Chartres is not small for his age.
    All my Lorraine children are robust; their mother is healthy
    and always well; she is not good for nothing like Mme.
    d&rsquo;Orléans. Never did any one hear of such laziness as hers.
    She has had a sofa made on which she can lie while playing
    lansquenet; we laugh at her, but it does no good. She plays
    cards lying down; she eats lying down; she reads lying
    down; in short, she spends nearly all her life lying down.
    It must be bad for her health; and in fact, she is almost always
    ill; one day she complains of her head, another of her
    stomach. But it seems, in spite of that, she can make robust
    children; her three eldest daughters are strong and healthy;
    the first and third are tall and stout; they are built like
    men,&mdash;Mlle. de Valois especially.</p>
<p>The Montespan, the <i>guenipe</i>, and all the waiting-women
    made Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans believe that she did my son great
    honour in consenting to marry him. She cannot endure any
    contradiction on the subject of her vanity in being daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> of the king; she does not comprehend the difference between
    legitimate and bastard children; her nature is proud and
    full of vanity; my son often calls her in jest Madame
    Lucifer. She takes all the flattering things that are said to
    her as her right. She thinks her husband prefers his eldest
    daughter, the Duchesse de Berry, to her; the daughter has
    no great affection for her mother.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>The person whom I hope to see correct herself [the Duchesse
    de Berry] has judgment and a good heart. One might
    hope for her return to better ways if she were not in the
    midst of such bad company; her aunts and cousins on the
    maternal side also set her a bad example, for they lead
    the most irregular lives. The mother acts only from caprice;
    one day she hates her daughter without knowing why;
    another she approves of all she does, good or bad; that
    makes me fear that the good resolutions made at Easter will
    have no results, and that the devil will return to the house
    he left, accompanied by seven other evil spirits more wicked
    than himself, as Holy Scripture tells us. In short, one sees
    and hears nothing here but grievous things; I can do nothing;
    and I am most sincerely afflicted. My daughter did
    not stay here long enough for her good example to have any
    effect. They asked me how I managed to bring her up so
    well; I answered: by always talking reason to her; by
    showing her why such or such a thing was good or bad; by
    never passing over any foolish caprice; by striving as much
    as possible that she should not see bad examples; by not
    disheartening her with attacks of ill-humour; by praising
    virtue, and inspiring her with a horror of vice of all
    kinds. That is how I brought up my daughter, who,
    thanks be to God, has won the respect of all. But it is
    not to be supposed that we can bring up children without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> giving ourselves great trouble; vigilance and activity
    are indispensable.</p>
<p>In Germany there is one good thing: those who put no
    curb upon their conduct are despised. Here it is not so;
    youth imagines that the lectures of old persons are simply
    the result of bitterness in those who did the same things
    themselves in other days. People with bad reputations are
    just as well received and treated as those who have always
    led good lives; and it is that sight which ruins youth.</p>

<p>I write you with a troubled heart, and yesterday I wept
    the whole morning. The good and pious Queen of England
    died at seven o&rsquo;clock yesterday morning at Saint-Germain.
    Assuredly she is now in heaven. She did not keep a penny
    for herself, but gave all she had to the poor; she supported
    whole families; she never said an unkind thing of any one,
    no matter who, and if others began to talk to her about their
    neighbours, she would say: &ldquo;If it is harm of any one, I beg
    you not to tell me.&rdquo; She bore her misfortunes with perfect
    resignation; she was polite and agreeable, though far from
    being handsome; she was always cheerful and was constantly
    praising our Princess of Wales. I loved her well,
    and her death grieves my heart. She died with sincere
    satisfaction, thanking God for delivering her from this world.
    I think, as you do, that we may look upon her as sainted;
    more so than her husband; though I believe that he is also
    in heaven; he suffered with great resignation. The queen
    had great firmness, and true royal qualities, much generosity,
    politeness, and judgment. She used to joke me
    about my liking for the theatre. She told me once,
    laughing, that there had been a time when she could not
    go out, because her horses were dead and she had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> money to buy others, but she never complained of her
    misfortunes.</p>
<p>She was very thin, but more so in the body than in her
    face, which was long, the eyes spiritual, the teeth white and
    large, the skin wan, which showed all the more because she
    never wore rouge; she had a good expression of countenance,
    and was always very clean. My son, out of compassion for
    her poor servants, has allowed quite a number of them to
    keep their pensions.</p>
<p>It is perfectly false that she left great sums of money
    behind her. She supported her son, as well as her household;
    she gave pensions to most of her ladies; she maintained
    whole families of English people, and deprived herself
    of necessaries to succour the poor in hospitals. In the
    matter of cupidity she was not an Italian, for she never laid
    a penny aside. It may truly be said that she had all the
    royal virtues. Her sole fault (for no one is perfect) was in
    pushing her piety to such extremes; but she paid dear for that,
    as it was really the cause of all her misfortunes. She could
    not make any savings while living in France, for her pension
    was paid irregularly, and she was forced to borrow money
    and make debts. It is not true that her servants pillaged
    her furniture. She was lodged at Saint-Germain, where the
    furniture belongs to the king. Few queens of England have
    been happy; and the kings themselves in that land have not
    had much to make them so.</p>

</p>
<p>Mme. de Berry has nursed her mother through an illness
    with the devotion of a Gray Sister. I should be very ungrateful
    if I did not feel attachment to her, for she shows
    me all possible friendship and treats me with such politeness
    that I am often quite touched by it. The Maintenon was
    so afraid that the king would like the Duchesse de Berry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> and thus be detached from the dauphine, that she did her as
    many ill-turns as she could. But after the death of the
    dauphine she patched matters up, though, to tell the truth,
    the liking of the king for the duchess was never great.</p>
<p>Nothing new from England: the king is defiant and suspicious.
    The English are wily and think only of their own
    interests; they see very well that they can fish in troubled
    waters, and that as long as there is ill-will between father
    and son, the king will not think of tightening his authority
    upon them. They therefore endeavour to keep up the ill-temper
    that is natural to him. I do not believe he will
    return to Hanover as soon as some people think. I heard
    from the Princess of Wales yesterday that she had written
    to the king a most submissive letter; the king answered it
    harshly and made her many reproaches on her behaviour.
    He will get himself laughed at for behaving in that way;
    for the good reputation of the princess is perfectly established.
    I cannot comprehend the king&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Letters of</span> 1718-1719.</h3>
<p class="sig"> <span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>Historians often tell lies. They say in the history of my
    grandfather, the King of Bohemia, that my grandmother, the
    queen, carried away by her ambition, never left her husband
    a moment&rsquo;s peace until he declared himself king. There is
    not a single word of truth in all that. The queen thought of
    nothing but seeing comedies and ballets and reading novels.
    They also say in the history of the late king that it was
    from generosity he retired from Holland and consented to
    make peace. The truth is that Mme. de Montespan, after
    giving birth to a daughter (now Mme. la Duchesse), had returned
    to Versailles, and the king longed to see her.</p>
<p>They also attribute the first war in Holland to the king&rsquo;s
    ambition, whereas I am positively sure that war was undertaken
    because M. de Lionne, then minister, was jealous of
    his wife on account of Prince William of Furstemberg. To
    get the prince out of France he began the war against
    Holland and the emperor. If historians lie in that way
    about things that have passed before our noses, what are we
    to believe as to the things that are far away from us and
    happened a great many years ago? I think that histories,
    except those in Holy Writ, are as false as novels; the only
    difference is that the latter are more amusing.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nothing new here. I am told that yesterday a man,
    wanting to beat his wife, with whom he was displeased,
    prayed thus: &ldquo;My good God, command that the blows I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> about to give thy servant may correct her and make her
    virtuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went to Paris yesterday to see my son and his family
    and be present at the representation of a new play, called
    &ldquo;Artaxerxes,&rdquo; in which there was nothing extraordinary,
    though there were one or two fine points. On entering my
    box they gave me your letter of the 7th.</p>
<p>I am so well at Saint-Cloud, where I am tranquil and
    happy, whereas in Paris I am never allowed an instant of
    rest; one person brings me a petition, another requests me
    to use my influence, another solicits an audience, another
    demands an answer to all the letters he has written, until I
    really cannot bear it any longer. And then people are surprised
    that I am not charmed with my fate! In this world
    great people have their troubles as well as little people; that
    is not surprising; but what is very annoying for the first is
    that they are always surrounded by a crowd, so that they
    cannot hide their griefs nor indulge them in solitude; they
    are always on exhibition.</p>
<p>My son does not like the country, he cares for nothing
    but the life of cities. In that he resembles Mme. de Longueville,
    who was extremely bored in Normandy, where her husband
    lived. Those about her said, &ldquo;Good God! madame,
    ennui is gnawing you to death; why not take some amusement?
    Here are horses and dogs and forests; will you
    hunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will
    you embroider?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t like embroidery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you
    take a walk, or play at some game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t like
    either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what will you do?&rdquo; some one asked her.</p>
<p>She answered: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say; but I don&rsquo;t like innocent
    pleasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Duchesse de Longueville was sister of the
    Prince de Condé. She had led a very irregular life, but
    afterwards repented and did penance, and never ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> to fast and pray for the rest of her days. She changed
    so much that no one could imagine she had ever been
    handsome; her figure alone preserved its grace&mdash;but these
    are old tales.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>Nothing new, except that my son came here yesterday
    afternoon and brought me the decree which alters the legal
    value of the currency. The <i>louis d&rsquo;or</i> will henceforth be
    worth thirty-six francs; those who have a great deal of
    money will profit finely. I am not of that number; it is a
    long time since money and I have kept company.</p>
<p>You ask me if foreigners professing the Lutheran religion
    can obtain military employments here. No, they are never
    admitted except into the Alsace regiment and the Swiss
    corps.</p>
<p>All parliament is unchained against my son, and it is
    certainly sustained by the eldest of the bastards [Duc du
    Maine] and his wife. As soon as any one speaks ill of my
    son and shows himself dissatisfied, the duchess invites him
    to Sceaux, cajoles and pities him, and spares nothing to
    excite him still further against my son. I am amazed at his
    patience. He has courage, goes his straight road, and does
    not fret himself about anything. The parliament of Paris
    has made an appeal to all the other parliaments of France
    to unite with it; but none as yet have committed that
    folly; on the contrary, they have shown themselves faithful
    to my son. Everything has been done to rouse the people
    against him by spreading libels, but so far without effect;
    I think more would have been produced if the bastard and
    his wife had not been mixed up in the matter, because
    they are detested in Paris. I think what prevents my son
    from acting with vigour against the Duc du Maine is,
    first, that he dreads the tears and anger of his wife, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> next, that he loves his other brother-in-law, the Comte de
    Toulouse.</p>
<p>My son will soon find means to pay the debts of the
    late king, for Law (or Lass as they call him in France) is an
    Englishman who has great talent. The people are not more
    pressed than they were in the days of the king, but they
    are not relieved, and my son&rsquo;s enemies profit by that unfortunate
    circumstance to rouse the public hatred against
    him. It is false that he accumulates money; he has never
    touched what comes to him as regent. I do not believe
    there exists in the world a more disinterested being; he is
    even too much so; he makes beggars of his children. Nearly
    all the tales told in the gazettes about him are lies.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>I thought M. Law was an Englishman but it seems he is
    a Scotchman; and in point of fact horribly ugly; but he
    appears to be a worthy man and he has much talent; he
    came near dying yesterday of an attack of colic. Parliament
    is not quiet yet; it still makes remonstrances. Everything
    is so horribly ruined in the kingdom that my son will never
    in all his life have rest or satisfaction again.</p>
<p>The wife of the humpback [Duchesse du Maine] desired
    to have an interview and explanation with my son. She
    spoke with emphasis, as she does when she acts comedy,
    and told him he ought not to believe that the answer to
    Fitzmaurice&rsquo;s book emanated from her; that a princess of
    the blood like herself did not condescend to write libels;
    that Cardinal de Polignac [her lover] had been employed
    in far too great affairs to meddle in such trifles; and that
    M. de Malézieux was too great a philosopher to know about
    anything but science; and as for herself, she was solely
    occupied in bringing up her children and making them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> worthy of the rank of princes of the blood&mdash;of which they
    were unjustly deprived. My son confined himself to saying:
    &ldquo;I have reason to believe that those libels were written
    in your house and for you; persons in your service have
    sworn that they saw them written; I cannot be made to
    either believe or disbelieve things.&rdquo; As to her last words he
    said nothing in reply, and went away. The lady boasted
    everywhere of the energy and firmness with which she spoke
    to him.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>Parliament thwarts my son and tries more than ever to
    excite the bourgeoisie and the populace of Paris against
    him, and great calamities may result. Every night in going
    to bed I thank God that no evil has happened during the
    day. Many persons here would like to have the King of
    Spain for king; he is a weak man and could be managed
    more easily than my son. Every one thinks solely of his
    own interest. It is asserted that the King of Spain has
    rights to the throne of France, and that a great wrong was
    done when he was induced to renounce his country. All
    this is said in view of the possible death of the little king.
    If he should die, my son would be king, but he would not
    be in greater safety than he is at this moment, and that
    death would be a great misfortune for him.</p>
<p>I have never known such a summer as this. It has not
    rained for weeks and the heat increases every day; the
    leaves on the trees are shrivelled as if a fire had gone over
    them. There are prophecies that rain will begin to fall on
    Wednesday. God grant it! but until it rains no one will
    see me in Paris. We think it is hot here, but every one who
    comes from Paris exclaims, &ldquo;Oh! how cool Saint-Cloud
    is!&rdquo; Paris is horrible, very hot and stinking; the streets
    have such a shocking smell one can&rsquo;t endure it; the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> heat has made the meat and the fish rot, and that, joined to
    the crowds of people who relieve themselves in the streets,
    makes an odour so detestable that it cannot be borne.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, August 30, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>Parliament had formed the fine project, if my son had
    postponed action twenty-four hours, to make the Duc du
    Maine ruler of France by declaring the king major and
    giving to the duke the sole direction of affairs. But my
    son has disconcerted all this by removing the Duc du
    Maine from the king and degrading him to his proper rank.
    They say that the president of parliament was so frightened
    that he sat petrified as if he had seen the head of Medusa.
    But Medusa herself could not stop the fury of the Duchesse
    du Maine. She launched into horrible threats, and said
    publicly she would soon find means to give the regent a
    fillip that should make him bite the dust. It is thought
    the old <i>guenipe</i> is intriguing underhand in this matter with
    her pupil.</p>
<p>I went this morning to Paris where there is great
    uproar. My son made the king hold a <i>lit de justice</i>, to
    which the parliament was summoned, and was formally
    enjoined, in the king&rsquo;s name, not to meddle with the government,
    but to keep to its own province, that of judging
    cases and doing justice. The new Keeper of the Seals was
    installed in office, and as it was known positively that the
    Duc du Maine and his wife were exciting parliament against
    the king and against my son, the superintendence of the
    king&rsquo;s education was taken from him and given to M. le
    Duc; he was also deprived, he and his children, of the
    right to be treated as princes of the blood; but they maintained
    the younger brother in all his privileges because he
    has always conducted himself well.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>The parliament people and the Duchesse du Maine are so
    furious against my son that I am constantly afraid they will
    assassinate him. The duchess makes the most insulting
    speeches; she said at table: &ldquo;They say that I push parliament
    to revolt against the Duc d&rsquo;Orléans; but I despise
    him too much to take such a noble vengeance against him&mdash;I
    shall know how to avenge myself otherwise.&rdquo; You see
    what a fury that woman is, and whether I have not good
    reason to be in a continual agony.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>I know all about the tragical affair of the czarewitch;
    an exact account of it has been rendered to my son by
    the people over there. There are many lies about it in
    the newspapers; the czar is not as barbarous as he was
    before he travelled here and to other Courts. The czarewitch
    had taken part in a plot the object of which was to
    kill his father; it was from papers written by his own hand
    that he was condemned to death. He began by denying
    everything, and they could not have convicted him if his
    mistress had not betrayed him and given up his papers.
    My son told me last night at the theatre that the czar had
    assembled a great Council, in which were the bishops and
    all the councillors of State. He had his son brought before
    them, embraced him, and said: &ldquo;Is it possible that after
    I spared your life you were trying to assassinate me?&rdquo;
    The prince denied everything. Then the czar gave to the
    Council the letters which had been seized, and said: &ldquo;I
    cannot judge my own son; judge him, and let him find
    mercy and not be proceeded against by the full rigour of
    the law.&rdquo; The Council unanimously condemned the prince
    to death. When the czarewitch heard the sentence he was
    overcome with emotion and remained some hours without
    being able to speak. Then he asked to see his father once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> more before he died. He confessed everything to him and
    begged his forgiveness with tears. He lived two days after
    that, and he died in the greatest repentance. Between ourselves,
    I think they poisoned him, so as not to have the
    shame of seeing him in the hands of the executioner. It
    is a dreadful story and has the air of a tragedy; it is like
    those of Livius Andronicus.</p>
<p>I am still very uneasy on the subject of my son. He
    has unfortunately many enemies, but still more false friends;
    everything is to be feared from both. One of my grand-daughters
    is determined to be a nun, in spite of my wishes
    and those of her father. The mother has brought her
    children up in a way that is a matter of derision and shame;
    I am forced to see it daily; but all that I could say would
    do no good.</p>
<p>My heart is full when I think that is the day when our
    poor Mlle. de Chartres is to make her profession. I have
    represented to her all I could think of to turn her from that
    cursed resolution, but without result. In convents the nuns
    take the names of saints; my grand-daughter has taken
    that of Sister Batilde. No one is afflicted to the point
    of weeping, which would surely have happened to me had
    I been present at her profession. I do not know the
    motives that determined her; she only told me that she
    felt herself perfectly capable of enduring the life.</p>
<p>Mlle. de Valois, the fourth daughter, is not on good terms
    with her mother, who tried in vain to make her marry
    the Prince de Dombes, the eldest son of the Duc du Maine.
    The mother constantly reproaches the daughter and tells
    her that if she had married her nephew the misfortune
    which has fallen upon her brother would never have happened.
    She is so unwilling to have her daughter before her
    eyes that she has asked me to keep her for a while with me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>The old <i>guenipe</i> must think herself immortal to still wish
    to reign though she is eighty-three years old. The blow
    which struck the Duc du Maine has shaken her roughly.
    But she has not lost all hope, and she is so little scrupulous
    as to the means of reaching her ends, that I am very uneasy,
    for I know what usage she can make of poison. What has
    happened to the Duc du Maine is a terrible blow to her, and
    my son is never upon his guard; he goes about the environs
    at night in strange carriages; he sups in one place and then
    in another with his companions, among whom are many who
    are quite worthless; they are clever enough, but have no
    good quality.</p>
<p>People talk in diverse ways of the Duchesse du Maine.
    Some people say she beat her husband and broke the mirrors
    in her room to bits, also everything else that was breakable
    when she received the news of his overthrow. Others say
    she never said a word and only wept. M. le Duc is charged
    with the education of the king. He said that he did not in
    the beginning ask for that office because he had not reached
    his majority; but now in the actual state of things he did
    demand it, and he obtained it.</p>
<p>I must tell you of a most amusing dialogue between Lord
    Stair and the Spanish ambassador, Prince Cellamare. The
    latter had reported all over Paris that it was entirely false
    that the English fleet had beaten the Spanish fleet; and the
    partisans of Spain who are here managed so well that the
    news of the defeat was no longer believed, when, suddenly,
    the son of Admiral Byng arrived, bringing the official account
    of the action and a list of the ships which the English had
    captured, burned, or sunk. Lord Stair, having received these
    documents, said to Prince Cellamare: &ldquo;Well, monsieur,
    what do you say now about your fleet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; replied
    the ambassador, &ldquo;that the fleet is safely at Cadiz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> not talking about the fleet at Cadiz,&rdquo; said Stair. &ldquo;I mean
    that of Messina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fleet of Cadiz and all the galleons
    richly laden have entered the port of Cadiz,&rdquo; returned the
    prince; and no other answer could be got from him.</p>
<p>The little dwarf [Duchesse du Maine] says she has more
    courage than her husband, her sons, and her brother-in-law,
    and, like another Jael, she will kill my son by hammering
    a nail into his head. My son does not trouble himself about
    her threats. When I tell him he ought to be upon his guard,
    he laughs and shakes his head as if I were talking nonsense.
    But the perils that surround my son&rsquo;s existence make me
    spend many a sleepless night, and certainly his regency has
    not been to me a subject of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>The affair of the Duc du Maine is not one of those things
    that can be forgotten, at least not so long as those two old
    hussies are living [Mme. de Maintenon and the Princesse des
    Ursins]; for they stir him up, together with his little devil
    of a wife, to all sorts of secret plotting against my son.
    Mme. des Ursins has one good thing about her, however:
    she does not call upon the good God to assist her intrigues.
    My son is not in safety, and that troubles me extremely. I
    do my best to be resigned to the divine will and to accept
    whatever it provides; but the heart of a mother is too tender
    about an only son.</p>
<p>You may move lions and tigers and all sorts of wild beasts
    sooner than wicked people when ambition and cupidity are
    the cause of their enmity. All arguers on the condition of
    the country do not know the deplorable state in which my
    son found the kingdom. When the change in the government
    occurred each person imagined he would grow rich;
    they praised my son and expected marvels of him; as these
    marvels have not been realized, because they were impossible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> blame is now substituted for praise. There would be
    little harm if such complaints exhaled in words, but the
    discontented are forming intrigues and plots. The French
    will not stop at anything, and they do not know what
    gratitude is.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1718.<br />
</p>
<p>When I first came to France I saw here many persons
    such as one may not find again in centuries. There was
    Lulli, for music; Beauchamp, for ballets; Corneille and
    Racine, for tragedy; Molière, for comedy; la Chamelle and
    Beauval, actresses; Baron, Lafleur, Torilière, and Guérin,
    actors. All these persons excelled in their vocations. La
    Duclos and la Raisin were equally good; the latter had a
    great deal of charm. Her husband was also excellent in
    comic parts. There was likewise a good harlequin and a
    capital scaramouch. There were good singers at the opera,
    Clédière, Pomerueil, Godenarche, Duménil, la Rochechouard,
    Mauvry, la Saint-Christophe, la Brigogne, la Beaucreux. All
    that one sees and hears now does not come up to such
    talents.</p>
<p>Everything goes to beat of drum between my son and
    his mistresses, without the least gallantry. It reminds me
    of the old patriarchs who had so many women. My son has
    a good deal of King David about him; he has courage and
    spirit, he is a good musician, he is small, brave, and ready to
    love any woman; he is not particular in that respect; provided
    they are good-humoured, very shameless, and can eat
    and drink a great deal, he does not mind about their faces.</p>
<p>The Duc du Maine and his party have let his sister [the
    Duchesse d&rsquo;Orléans] know that if my son dies she will
    be made regent, and they have promised her they would
    then act in all things by her will, and she would be the
    greatest figure that there was in the world. They told her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> they meant no harm to my son, but that he could not live
    long, his life was so disorderly; that he must die soon, or
    else become blind, in which case he would consent to her
    exercising the regency. I heard all this from a person to
    whom the Duc du Maine himself told it; and when one
    knows it one is not surprised that Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans wanted to
    force her daughter to marry the Duc du Maine&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>Thank God, my son is now in perfect health; he came
    here last night and supped and slept, and returned this morning
    to Paris; he was very gay indeed. He told us that in
    Spain they have enormous grapes that intoxicate like wine,
    and that once after eating only one grape his head swam;
    he went to a convent and said all sorts of foolish things to
    the nuns, without knowing what he was talking about.</p>
<p>Mme. du Maine is not larger than a child of ten. When
    she shuts her mouth she is not ugly, but she has villanous,
    irregular teeth. She is not very plump, has pretty eyes,
    and is white and fair, but puts on a horrible quantity
    of rouge. If she was as good as she is bad there would
    be nothing to say against her; but her malignancy is
    intolerable. She is easy during the day, which she spends
    playing cards, but when evening comes the tempers and
    the follies begin; she torments her husband, her children,
    and her servants till they do not know how to bear it. She
    is no beauty, but she has a great deal of intelligence; she
    is very well educated and can talk on all sorts of subjects,
    and that attracts to her learned men; she knows how to
    flatter the discontented and excite them against my son.
    She is lord and master of her husband. He holds many
    offices and can give places to a great many persons: in the
    regiment of the guards, of which he is general; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> artillery, of which he is grand-master; in the carbineers, to
    which he appoints all officers; he has also his own regiment;
    and these favours rally to him a great many persons.</p>

<p>My son has found himself obliged to arrest Prince
    Cellamare, because they found on his messenger, who was
    the Abbé Porto-Carrero, letters from the ambassador which
    revealed a conspiracy against the king and against my son.
    The ambassador was arrested by two of the Councillors of
    State. In his secret despatches he warned Alberoni to be
    very careful not to be on good terms with my son, because
    as soon as the treaty was signed he meant to poison the little
    king; the ambassador added that he would see that my
    son had his hands too full to think of war, for he had
    brought a number of provinces to promise to revolt; that
    their party was strong in Paris, and that Alberoni had only
    to send money and not spare it. I believe the lamester,
    brother of my daughter-in-law, will be found in this affair.
    The ambassador has been interrogated by the two Councillors
    of State, and he admitted, laughing, that he wrote the
    letters in order to avoid the evils of war, and wanted simply
    to frighten my son. When they asked him why he had
    said such infamies of the regent, he replied that he must
    admit there had been a little poison in his remarks, but
    that poison was necessary to compose an antidote. What
    is very strange is that the Maréchal de Noailles, once my
    son&rsquo;s sub-governor, is implicated in the plot; that is because
    he is related to that devil incarnate, the Princesse
    des Ursins, who will pursue my son to the death,&mdash;her sole
    motive being that he thought her too old to wish to be her
    lover. Cellamare&rsquo;s letters have been printed, so that every
    one can see the thread of the conspiracy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>If the Abbé Dubois were at his first lie he would be dead
    long ago; he is passed master in the art of lying, above all
    when it is to his personal advantage; if I wrote down all
    that I know about that, it would make a long litany. It
    was he who clandestinely told the king at the time of my
    son&rsquo;s marriage what he had better say and do to bring it
    about; he also had conferences on that subject with the
    Maintenon. He behaves now as if he thought that he and
    I were perfectly agreed, and no matter what disagreeable
    things I say to him, he turns them all into jest. I will do
    him justice and say he is a man of capacity; he talks well
    and is good company; but he is false and selfish as the
    devil; he looks like a fox, his deceitfulness can be read in
    his eyes. His portrait might be made as a fox crouching
    on the ground to pounce on a hen. But he can express
    himself so well as an honest man that I regarded him as
    such till the marriage of my son; it was then I discovered
    his trickery. If that abbé were as good a Christian as he
    is an able man, he would be excellent; but he believes in
    nothing, and it is that which makes him false and a scoundrel.
    He is well-informed, no doubt of that, and he gave
    my son a good education; but I wish he had never seen
    him, and then this miserable marriage, which I deplore,
    would never have taken place. Except the Abbé Dubois,
    no priest has any favour with my son.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1719.<br />
</p>
<p>It is certain that my son is much to be pitied on account
    of his wife, and for this, if there were no other reason, I
    cannot comprehend why he should like the Abbé Dubois
    as he does; for it was that abbé who persuaded him to
    consent to the marriage and plunged him into all that
    affliction. My son sees his wife every day; if she is in
    a good humour he stays a long time with her; if she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> out of temper, which often happens, he goes away and says
    nothing.</p>
<p>I used to be attached to the Abbé Dubois because I
    thought that he truly loved my son and only thought of his
    good and his advantage; but when I found he was a faithless
    dog looking to nothing but his own interests, and did
    not care in the least for my son&rsquo;s honour, but was helping to
    precipitate him to eternal damnation by letting him plunge
    into debauchery, all my esteem for that little priest changed
    to contempt. I heard from my son himself that the abbé
    met him once as he was about to enter a bad house, and
    instead of taking him by the arm and leading him away,
    he only laughed. By such laxity and by my son&rsquo;s marriage
    he proved that neither faith, fidelity, nor decency was
    in him. I am not wrong in suspecting him of taking part
    in that marriage. What I know I have from my son himself
    and from the persons around the old <i>vilaine</i> in the
    days when the abbé went to her secretly at night to help
    her intrigues and betray the young master whom he sold.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1719.<br />
</p>
<p>I am so troubled that my hand trembles: my son has
    come to tell me that he has been obliged to decide on arresting
    his brother-in-law, the Duc du Maine and the duchess.
    They are the leaders of the shocking Spanish plot. All is
    discovered; the papers of the ambassador of Spain were
    seized, the persons arrested have confessed. The duchess,
    being a princess of the blood [daughter of M. le Prince de
    Condé], was arrested by four captains of the guard; her husband,
    who was in the country, by a lieutenant. That makes
    a great difference between them. The duchess was sent
    to Dijon, and her husband to Doullens, a little fortress.
    Their people who were in the plot have been put in the
    Bastille.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p>Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans is much distressed, but is much more
    reasonable than Mme. la Duchesse. She says that, as her
    husband was compelled to adopt such rigorous measures
    against his brother-in-law, there must have been strong
    reasons.</p>
<p>There is great discord among the clergy. The bishops
    are disunited; some are for the pope and the doctrine of
    the Jesuits; others support the Jansenists. I wish that
    both sides took more care to live like Christians and die
    well; leaving disputes to those who find them to their
    taste. I do not trouble myself about either party.</p>
<p>Cardinals cannot be arrested, but you can exile them.
    Cardinal de Polignac has therefore received orders to retire
    to one of his abbeys and stay there. Love turned his head.
    He was formerly a good friend to my son, but he changed
    as soon as he attached himself to that little frog. Magny
    is not yet arrested; he is hiding from convent to convent
    among the Jesuits. My son showed me a letter that Mme.
    du Maine had written to Cardinal de Polignac, which was
    seized among his papers. A most virtuous and estimable
    person she is, truly! In this fine letter she says: &ldquo;We go
    to-morrow to the country; I will arrange the apartments so
    that your room can be near mine; try to manage as well as
    last time, and we will give ourselves heart-joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1719.<br />
</p>
<p>I wrote you that the Duc and Duchesse du Maine were
    the leaders of the plot; since then the proof of the duke&rsquo;s
    culpability has been found in a letter to him from Alberoni,
    in which are these words: &ldquo;As soon as war is declared, fire
    all your mines.&rdquo; Nothing can be clearer. They are great
    wretches.</p>
<p>Though the treason is discovered, all the traitors are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> yet known. My son laughs and says: &ldquo;I hold the head
    and tail of the monster, but not its body as yet.&rdquo; The Duc
    and Duchesse du Maine have written on all sides to justify
    themselves. There is such wickedness and falsehood in
    what they say that I cannot endure the thought of it. No
    one can imagine the libels they have spread in the provinces
    about my poor son; they have also sent them to foreign
    countries.</p>
<p>Parliament is now on good terms with my son, and has
    rendered a judgment wholly in his favour; that shows how
    the du Maines had stirred it up against him. The Jesuits
    may, very likely, be secretly plotting against my son, for all
    the partisans of the Constitution [bull Unigenitus] are his
    adversaries; but they keep themselves quiet, and nothing is
    shown to compromise them. They are clever people. Mme.
    d&rsquo;Orléans is beginning to laugh and show satisfaction; which
    worries me, because I know she has consulted the president
    of parliament [Mesmes] and other persons to learn whether
    in case of her husband&rsquo;s death, she could be appointed regent
    with her son. The president answered no; that the regency
    would devolve on M. le Duc, which answer seemed to greatly
    disturb her.</p>
<p>My son made me laugh yesterday. I asked him how the
    Maintenon was; he answered, &ldquo;Wonderfully well.&rdquo; I said,
    &ldquo;How can that be, at her age?&rdquo; to which he replied: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    you know that the good God to punish the devil makes him
    stay a very long time in a villanous body?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, April 20, 1719.<br />
</p>
<p>Saturday evening we lost a pious soul at Saint-Cyr, the
    old Maintenon. The news of the arrest of the Duc du Maine
    and his wife made her faint away, and it may have been
    the cause of her death, for from that moment she had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> rest. Anger and the loss of the hope to reign through him
    turned her blood and gave her the measles, and for twenty
    days she had continual fever. A storm which came up
    made the disease strike inward, and it stifled her. She was
    eighty-six years old. I have it in my head that what
    grieved her most at the last was leaving my son and me
    behind her in good health.</p>
<p>She died like a young person. She gave herself eighty-two
    years, but she was really eighty-six. If she had died
    twenty years ago I should have cordially rejoiced, but now
    it gives me neither pleasure nor pain. There is nothing
    to wonder at in her dying like a young person. In the
    other world, where all are equal and there is no difference
    in rank, it will be decided whether she stays with the king
    or the paralytic Scarron; but if the king knows then all
    that was hidden from him in this world, there is no doubt
    he will return her very willingly to Scarron.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1719.<br />
</p>
<p>It appears that the Duc de Richelieu was not in the
    conspiracy of the Duc and Duchesse du Maine, but had a
    plot of his own, which has put him in the Bastille. He
    took it into his head that he was so considerable a person
    he could not be refused a certain marriage far above his just
    pretensions. When that hope vanished, he began, in his
    vexation, to plot. He is an arch-debauchee, and a coward;
    he believes in neither God nor His word; in all his life he
    never has done, and never will do a worthy thing; he is
    ambitious and false as the devil. He is not yet twenty-four
    years old. I do not think him as handsome as the Court
    women do, who are mad about him. He has a pretty figure
    and fine hair, an oval face and very brilliant eyes, but everything
    about him indicates a rascal; he is graceful and is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> without cleverness, but his insolence is great; he is the
    worst of spoiled youths. The first time he was put in
    the Bastille was for saying he was an actual lover of the
    Duchesse de Bourgogne and all her young ladies; which
    was a horrible lie.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1719.<br />
</p>
<p>You ask me what has recently made me so angry; I
    cannot tell it in detail, only in the gross. It is the horrible
    coquetry of Mlle. de Valois with that cursèd Duc de Richelieu,
    who has shown the letters that he had from her, for he
    only loves her from vanity. All the young seigneurs of the
    Court have read the letters in which she assigns him rendezvous.
    Her mother wanted me to take her here with me,
    which I refused curtly; but she is now returning to the
    charge. I am horribly vexed; the human species disgusts
    me. I cannot endure the idea of having her; but I must,
    to avoid worse scandal; the very sight of that heedless
    creature will make me ill. All this is the result of the
    apathy and nullity of the mother; may God forgive her!
    but she has brought up her daughters very ill.</p>
<p>The Duc de Richelieu is bold and full of impertinence;
    he knows the kindness of my son and abuses it; if justice
    were done he would pay for his man&#339;uvres and his temerity
    with his head; he has triply deserved it. I am not cruel, but
    I could see him hanging from a gibbet without a tear. He
    is now walking about on the rampart of the Bastille, curled
    and bedecked, while the ladies are standing in the street
    below to see that beautiful image. Many tears will be shed
    in Paris, for every woman is in love with him; I don&rsquo;t know
    why, for he is a little toad in whom I can see nothing
    agreeable. He has no courage; he is impertinent, faithless,
    and indiscreet; he says harm of all his mistresses; and yet
    a princess of the blood-royal [Mlle. de Charolais, grand-daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> of M. le Prince de Condé] is so in love with him
    that when he became a widower she wanted to marry him.
    Her grandmother and brother formally opposed it, and with
    reason, for independently of the misalliance she would have
    been, all her life, most unhappy. He has had each of his
    mistresses painted in the various habits of the religious
    orders: Mlle. de Charolais as a Franciscan nun,&mdash;they say it
    is an excellent likeness; the Maréchale de Villars and the
    Maréchale d&rsquo;Estrées in the Capucin habit.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1719.<br />
</p>
<p>I do not mingle in any way with what is going on in
    Rome. The pope and I have no relations with each other;
    therefore no one need address himself to me to get a dispensation.</p>
<p>It is not true that I have changed my name; I cannot
    be called in France by any other title than that of Madame,
    for my husband, as brother of the king, bore the title of
    Monsieur, and I as his wife cannot bear any other than
    that of Madame. The daughters of the king are also called
    so, but, to distinguish them, the baptismal name is added;
    for instance, the three daughters of Henri II. were called:
    Madame Élisabeth, who became Queen of Spain; Madame
    Henriette, who became Queen of England; and Madame
    Christine, who was afterwards Duchesse de Savoie. The
    daughters of the king&rsquo;s brother are called Mademoiselle;
    the eldest bears that title with nothing added to it; the
    others add the name of their appanage; that is how it is
    there is a Mademoiselle de Chartres, Mademoiselle de Valois,
    Mademoiselle de Montpensier. It is the same with the
    grandsons of the king; they should be called Monsieur with
    the names of their appanages attached; it was always an
    abuse to say the Duc de Bourgogne, the Duc de Berry:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> they ought to have been called Monsieur de Bourgogne,
    Monsieur de Berry.</p>
<p>I went last Sunday to see the Duchesse de Berry and
    found her in a sad state. She had such frightful pains in
    the soles and toes of her feet that the tears came into her
    eyes. I saw that my presence prevented her from screaming
    and so I came away. I thought she looked very ill.
    They have had a consultation of three physicians, who decided
    on bleeding from the foot. It was difficult to bring her to
    consent, for the suffering in her feet is so unbearable that
    she screams if the sheets merely touch them. However,
    the bleeding succeeded and she has suffered less since. It
    was gout in both feet.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1719.<br />
</p>
<p>I went yesterday to see the Duchesse de Berry; she is
    better, thank God, but she cannot walk yet. Two great
    boils have come upon the soles of her feet, which burn
    them as if with red-hot iron; it is a very singular illness.
    Twice a week they give her medicine, and the other days
    an enema; both do her good. It seems that her illness
    comes from the frightful gluttony in which she indulged
    last year.</p>
<p>I told you my son had a fever; he is better now; but I
    fear a relapse, for he is, to say the least, as much of a
    glutton as his daughter; and he will not listen to any
    advice.</p>
<p>The English nation is a wicked nation, false and ungrateful.
    Most of the persons of rank who were at Saint-Germain,
    whom the late queen supported (imposing upon
    herself personally the greatest privations in order to do so)
    now declaim against her, and tell a thousand lies of that
    good and virtuous queen. All this fills me with wrath.</p>
<p>My son is really too kind; that little Duc de Richelieu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> having assured him that he had fully intended to reveal to
    him the plot, he believed him and has set him at liberty.
    It is true that the duke&rsquo;s mistress, Mlle. de Charolais, never
    left my son a moment&rsquo;s peace about it. It is a horrible thing
    for a princess of the blood to declare in the face of all the
    world that she is as amorous as a cat, and that her passion is
    for a scoundrel of a rank so beneath her own that she cannot
    marry him, and who is moreover unfaithful to her, for he is
    known to have half a dozen other mistresses. When she is
    told of that she replies: &ldquo;Pooh! he only has them to sacrifice
    them to me and to tell me all that passes between them.&rdquo;
    It is really an awful thing.</p>
<p>If I believed in sorcery I should say that that duke possessed
    a supernatural power; for he has never yet found a
    woman who opposed him the slightest resistance; they all
    run after him, and it is literally shameful. He is not handsomer
    than others, and he is so indiscreet and gabbling that
    he says himself if an empress beautiful as an angel fell in
    love with him and wished to be his on condition that he
    would not tell of it, he should prefer to leave her on the spot
    and never look at her again. He is a great poltroon, but very
    insolent, without heart or soul. I revolt at the thought that
    he is the petted darling of women, and I am quite sure he
    will only show ingratitude for my son&rsquo;s kindness&mdash;but I
    will not say another word about that personage; he puts me
    out of all patience.</p>
<p>The harm that is said of M. Law and his bank is the effect
    of jealousy; for nothing better could be found. He is paying
    off the fearful debts of the late king, and he has diminished
    the taxes, lessening in that way the burdens that are
    weighing down the people; wood does not cost the half of
    what it did; the duties on wine, meats, in fact, all that is
    consumed in Paris have been abolished; and that has caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> great joy among the people, as you may suppose. M. Law
    is very polite. I think a great deal of him; he does all he
    can to be agreeable to me. He does not wish to act secretly,
    like those who have preceded him in the management of the
    finances, but publicly, with honour. It is quite false that he
    has bought a palace from the Duchesse de Berry; she has
    none to sell; all the houses she has return to the king,&mdash;such
    as Meudon, Châville, and La Muette.</p>
<p>Law is so pursued that he has no peace day or night; a
    duchess kissed his hands in sight of everybody, and if
    duchesses kiss his hands, what will not the other women
    kiss? Impossible to have more capacity than he, but I
    would not for all the gold in the world be in his place; he
    is tormented like a lost soul; besides which his enemies are
    spreading all sorts of wicked tales about him. I am tired
    out with hearing of nothing but shares and millions, and I
    cannot hide my ill-humour. People are flocking here from
    all corners of Europe; during the last month there have been
    in Paris two hundred and fifty thousand more persons than
    usual; they have had to make rooms in lofts and barns, and
    Paris is so full of carriages that there is great difficulty in
    getting through the streets, and many persons have been
    crushed. One lady meaning to say to M. Law, &ldquo;Give me a
    concession,&rdquo; called out in a loud voice, &ldquo;Ah! monsieur, give
    me a conception;&rdquo; to which M. Law replied: &ldquo;Madame, you
    have come too late; there is no way at present by which you
    can obtain one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am afraid that the excesses of the Duchesse de Berry in
    eating and drinking will put her underground. The fever
    never leaves her and she has two paroxysms of it daily.
    She shows neither impatience nor anger, though she suffered
    greatly from the emetic they gave her yesterday. She has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> become as thin and shrunken as she was fat; yesterday she
    confessed and received the communion.</p>

</p>
<p>The Duchesse de Berry died last night between two and
    three o&rsquo;clock; her end was very gentle; they say she died
    as if she fell asleep. My son remained beside her until
    she had entirely lost consciousness. She was his favourite
    child.</p>
<p>The poor duchess took her own life as surely as if she
    had put a pistol to her head; she secretly ate melons,
    figs, milk; she owned it to me herself, and her physician
    told me she locked her door against him and all the other
    doctors for fourteen days in order to do as she liked. When
    the storm came up, as it did, she turned to death. She said
    to me last night: &ldquo;Ah! Madame, that peal of thunder did
    me great harm,&rdquo;&mdash;and indeed it was very visible. She
    received the last sacraments with such firmness that it wrung
    our hearts.</p>
<p>My son has lost the power to sleep; his poor daughter
    could not have been saved; her head was full of water; she
    had an ulcer in the stomach, another in the hip, the rest of
    her inside was like <i>bouillie</i> and the liver attacked. She was
    taken at night, secretly, with all her household, to Saint-Denis.
    Such embarrassment was felt about her funeral
    oration that it was judged best to have none at all. She
    said she died without regret, because she was reconciled with
    God, and that if her life were prolonged she might offend
    Him again. That touched us in a way I cannot express.
    At heart she was a good person; and if her mother had
    taken more care of her and had brought her up better there
    would be nothing but good to say of her. I own that her
    loss goes to my heart&mdash;but let us talk of something else;
    this is too sad.</p>

<p>The reason you could not read my last letter was that it
    was partly torn by one of my dogs just as I finished it. I
    see you do not like dogs, for if you loved them as I do you
    would forgive their little faults. I have one, named <i>Reine
    inconnue</i>, which understands as well as a man, and never
    leaves me an instant without weeping and howling as long
    as I am out of her sight.</p>

</p>
<p>Yesterday, directly after my dinner, I went to Paris, and
    found my poor son in a state to melt a heart of rock.
    He is afflicted to the soul, and all the more because he sees
    that if he had not shown such excessive indulgence to his
    dear daughter, if he had better acted a father&rsquo;s part, she
    would now be living and healthy.</p>
<p>With all her revenues she leaves behind her debts amounting
    to 400,000 francs, for my son to pay. Those people
    about her robbed and pillaged the poor princess horribly;
    but that is always the way with a brood of favourites.
    Her marriage with that toad&rsquo;s head [Rion] is unhappily but
    too true. He is not, however, of a bad stock; he is allied
    to good families; the Duc de Lauzun is his uncle, and Biron
    his nephew; but, for all that, he was not worthy of the
    honours that came to him. He was only a captain in the
    king&rsquo;s regiment. Women ran after him. I thought him
    ugly and repulsive, and sickly looking besides. When the
    news of the Duchesse de Berry&rsquo;s death reached the army, the
    Prince de Conti went to find Rion and made him this pretty
    speech: &ldquo;She is dead, your milch cow, and you need not talk
    any more about her.&rdquo; My son feels rather stung; but he
    does not wish to seem to know of it.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1719.<br />
</p>
<p>I promised to tell you about my journey to Chelles [to
    witness the installation of her grand-daughter as abbess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> the convent of Chelles]. I started Thursday at seven o&rsquo;clock,
    with the Duchesse de Brancas, Mme. de Châteauthiers, and
    Mme. de Rathsamhausen; we arrived at half-past ten. My
    grandson, the Duc de Chartres, had already arrived; my son
    came a few minutes later; then Mlle. de Valois. Mme.
    d&rsquo;Orléans had herself bled expressly to be unable to come.
    She and the abbess are not very good friends; and besides,
    her extreme laziness would prevent her from getting up so
    early.</p>
<p>We went to the church. The <i>prie-dieu</i> of the abbess was
    placed in the nun&rsquo;s choir; it was violet velvet covered with
    gold <i>fleur-de-lis</i>; my <i>prie-dieu</i> was against the balustrade;
    my son and his daughter were behind my chair, because the
    princes of the blood cannot kneel upon my carpet; that is a
    right reserved to the grandsons of France. The whole of the
    king&rsquo;s band was in the loft. Cardinal de Noailles said mass.
    The altar is a very fine one of black and white marble with
    four thick columns of black marble; there are four beautiful
    statues of sainted abbesses, one so like our own abbess you
    might think it was her portrait; it was, however, carved
    before my grand-daughter was born, for she is only twenty-one
    years old.</p>
<p>Twelve monks of her Order, robed in splendid chasubles,
    came to serve the mass. After the cardinal had read the
    epistle, the master of ceremonies entered the nun&rsquo;s choir and
    brought out the abbess; she came with a very good air, followed
    by two abbesses, and half a dozen nuns of her own convent.
    She made a deep curtsey to the altar, then to me, and
    knelt down before the cardinal, who was seated in a great armchair
    before the altar. They brought in state the confession
    of faith, which she read, and after the cardinal had recited
    many prayers, he gave her a book containing the rules of the
    convent. She then returned to her place; and after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> <i>Credo</i> and the offertory had been read, she came forward
    again, accompanied by an abbess and her nuns. Two great
    wax tapers and two loaves of bread, one gilt, the other
    silvered, were brought, with which she made her offering.
    After the cardinal had taken the communion, she again knelt
    before him and he gave her the crozier. Then he took her
    to her seat, not at her <i>prie-dieu</i>, but to her seat as abbess, a
    sort of throne surmounted by the dais of a princess of the
    blood with the <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>. As soon as she was seated
    the trumpets and the hautboys sounded, and the cardinal,
    followed by all his priests, placed himself near the altar on
    the left side, crozier in hand, and they chanted the Te Deum.
    Next, all the nuns of the convent came forward, two and
    two, to testify their submission to their new abbess, making
    her a deep obeisance. That reminded me of the honours
    they pay Athys when they make him high priest of Cybele
    in the opera, and I almost thought they were going to sing,
    &ldquo;Before thee all bow down and tremble,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>After the Te Deum, we entered the convent about half-past
    twelve and sat down to table, my son and I, my
    grandson, the Duc de Chartres, the Princesse Victoire de
    Soissons, the young Demoiselle d&rsquo;Auvergne, daughter of Duc
    d&rsquo;Albret, and my three ladies. The abbess went to a table
    in her refectory with her sister, Mlle. de Valois, the two
    ladies who accompanied her, twelve abbesses, and all the
    nuns of the convent. It was droll to see so many black
    robes round a table. My son&rsquo;s people served a very fine
    repast; and after dinner was over they let the people come
    in and pillage the dessert and confectionery. At a quarter
    to five my carriage came, and I returned to Saint-Cloud.</p>
<p>You ask me if my Abbé de Saint-Albin and his brother
    the Chevalier d&rsquo;Orléans have the same mother; no. The
    chevalier is legitimatized, but the poor abbé has not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> so at all. He has the family look, and strongly resembles
    the late Monsieur; he is something like his father and is
    very like Mlle. de Valois. He is some years older than the
    chevalier and is very grieved to see his younger brother
    so much above him. The chevalier, who for some time
    past has been the grand-prior of France in the Order of
    Malta, is the son of Mlle. de Séry, formerly my maid-of-honour;
    she now calls herself Mme. d&rsquo;Argenton. The mother
    of the abbé is an opera-dancer named Florence. My son
    has also a daughter by the left hand, whom he does not
    recognize; he has married her to a Marquis de Ségur; her
    mother was Desmares, one of the best actresses in the
    king&rsquo;s troupe. I love the Abbé de Saint-Albin, and he
    deserves it. In the first place, he loves me sincerely, and
    in the next he conducts himself extremely well. He has
    intellect; he is reasonable, and there is no canting bigotry
    about him. He is not in as much favour with my son as
    he deserves, but he is the best young man in the world;
    well brought-up, pious, and virtuous; he is well educated
    but has no conceit. He is more like the late Monsieur
    than he is like his father; but it is plain where he comes
    from; my son cannot deny him; and it is a great pity
    that he is not my son&rsquo;s legitimate child.</p>
<p>The enormous wealth that is now in France is inconceivable.
    All the talk is in millions. I cannot understand
    it; but I see plainly that the God Mammon reigns in Paris
    absolutely. The late king would gladly have employed
    M. Law in the finances; but as he was not a Catholic the
    king said he could not trust him. Nothing is now thought
    of but Law&rsquo;s bank; a hundred tales are told of it. A lady
    gave her coachman an order to upset her in front of it, and
    when M. Law ran out, supposing from the cries that she
    had broken her neck or legs, she hastened to acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> it was only a stratagem to get speech with him.
    It is certainly a droll thing to see how everybody runs
    after that man, jostling each other merely to see him or
    his son.</p>
<p>M. le Duc and his mother have made, they say, two
    hundred and fifty millions; the Prince de Conti rather less,
    though people declare his gains amount to many millions;
    the two cousins never budge from the rue Quincampoix.
    But the one who has gained the most money is d&rsquo;Antin,
    who is terribly grasping.</p>
<p>M. Law has abjured at Melun; he has become a Catholic,
    and so have his children; his wife is in despair. He is
    not avaricious; he does much in charity, without letting it
    be known, and gives away great sums; he helps large numbers
    of poor people.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Letters of</span> 1720-1722.</h3>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1720.</p>
<p>I have often walked about at night in the gallery of the
    château of Fontainebleau, where they say the ghost of the
    late king François I. appears; but the good man never did
    me the honour to appear to me; perhaps he does not think
    my prayers sufficiently efficacious to call him out of purgatory;
    and in that he may be right enough.</p>
<p>I was very gay in my youth; that is why they called
    me in German <i>Rauschen petten Knecht</i>. I remember the
    birth of the King of England [George I.] as if it had
    been yesterday. I was a very roguish, inquisitive child.
    They put a doll in a clump of rosemary and tried to make
    me believe that it was the child that I was told my aunt
    was going to have; but just at that moment I heard her
    scream, which did not agree with the baby in the rosemary
    bush. I pretended that I believed them, but I slipped into
    my aunt&rsquo;s chamber as if I were playing hide and seek with
    young Bulau and Haxthausen, and hid behind a great
    screen they had placed beside the chimney next the door.
    Presently they brought the child to the fireplace to bathe it,
    and I ran out of my hiding-place. I ought to have been
    whipped, but in honour of the happy event I was only well
    scolded.</p>
<p>The late king was so attached to the old customs of the
    royal family that he would not have allowed any of them to
    be changed for all the world. Mme. de Fiennes used to say
    that they clung so to old ways in the royal household that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> the queen died with a frilled cap on her head such as they
    tie on children when they put them to bed. When the
    king wished a thing he never allowed any one to argue
    against it; the thing he ordered must be done at once without
    reply. He was too used to &ldquo;such is our good pleasure&rdquo;
    to brook an observation. He was very severe in the etiquette
    he established about him. At Marly it was quite another
    thing; there he allowed no ceremony. Neither ambassadors
    nor envoys were invited to go there, and he never gave
    audiences; there was no etiquette, and everything went along
    pell-mell. On the promenades the king made the men wear
    their hats, and in the salon every one, down to the captains
    and sub-lieutenants of the foot-guards, was allowed to sit
    down. That gave me such a disgust for the salon that I
    never chose to stay there. My son is like all the rest of
    the family, he wants the things to which he has been accustomed
    from his youth to go on forever. That is why he
    cannot part with the Abbé Dubois, though he knows his
    knavery. That abbé wanted to persuade me, myself, that
    the marriage of my son was very advantageous for him. I
    replied: &ldquo;And Honour, monsieur, what can repair that?&rdquo;
    The Maintenon had made great promises to him and also to
    my son, but, thanks be to God, she did not keep her word
    to either of them.</p>

        wife of Louis XIV</i></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have had few queens in France who have been perfectly
    happy. Marie de&rsquo; Medici died in exile; the mother
    of the king and Monsieur was miserable as long as her
    husband lived; and our own queen, Marie-Thérèse, used to
    say that since she became queen she had never had but one
    day of true contentment. She was certainly excessively
    silly, but the best and most virtuous woman on earth; she
    had grandeur, and she knew well how to hold a Court.
    She believed all the king told her, good and bad. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> accoutrements were ridiculous; and her teeth were black
    and decayed, which came, they said, from eating chocolate,
    and she also ate a great deal of garlic. She was clumsy
    and short, and had a very white skin; when she neither
    danced nor walked she looked taller than she was. She ate
    frequently, and was very long about it, because it was always
    in little scraps as if for a canary. She never forgot her
    native land, and many of her ways were Spanish. She
    loved cards beyond measure, and played at <i>bassette</i>, <i>reversi</i>,
    and <i>ombre</i>, sometimes at <i>petit prime</i>, but she never won,
    because she could never learn to play well. While she and
    the first dauphine lived there was never anything at Court
    but modesty and dignity. Those who were licentious in
    secret affected propriety in public; but after the old <i>guenipe</i> began to govern and to introduce the bastards among the
    royal family everything went topsy-turvy.</p>
<p>The queen had such a passion for the king that she tried
    to read in his eyes what would please him, and provided he
    looked at her kindly she was gay all day. She was glad
    when the king passed the night with her, for being a true
    Spanish woman she did not dislike that business; whenever
    it happened she was so gay everybody knew of it. She
    liked to be joked about it, and would laugh, wink her eyes,
    and rub her little hands.</p>
<p>She died of an abscess which she had under the arm.
    Instead of drawing it outside, Fagon, who by great ill-luck
    was just then her doctor, bled her; that made the abscess
    break within; the whole of it fell upon the heart, and the
    emetic which he gave her choked her. The surgeon who
    bled her said to Fagon: &ldquo;Monsieur, have you reflected? This
    will be the death of my mistress.&rdquo; Fagon replied: &ldquo;Do as I
    order you, Gervais.&rdquo; The surgeon wept and said to Fagon:
    &ldquo;Do you compel me to be the one to kill my mistress?&rdquo; At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> eleven o&rsquo;clock he bled her; at twelve Fagon gave her a great
    dose of emetic, and at three the queen departed for another
    world. We may indeed say that the happiness of France
    died with her. The king was much moved, but that old
    devil of a Fagon did it on purpose, in order to bring about
    the fortunes of the old <i>guenipe</i>. The king always showed
    consideration for his wife, and required his mistresses to
    respect her. He liked her because of her virtue and the
    sincere attachment she felt for him in spite of his infidelities.
    He was sincerely afflicted when she died.</p>

</p>
<p>One hears of nothing every day but bank-bills. I think
    it very hard not to see gold. For forty-eight years I have
    always had fine gold pieces in my pocket, and now there is
    nothing to be seen but silver money, and that of little value.</p>
<p>It is very certain that M. Law is now most horribly disliked.
    My son told me something in the carriage to-day
    which moved me so much that the tears came into my eyes.
    He said: &ldquo;The populace said a thing that touched me to
    the heart; I feel it deeply.&rdquo; I asked him what it was, and
    he replied that when the Comte de Horn was executed the
    people said: &ldquo;If anything is done against the regent personally
    he forgives it all; but if anything is done against
    us, he listens to no nonsense, but does justice.&rdquo; M. Law
    has no bad intentions; he buys landed property and shows
    in that way that he means to stay in France. I do not
    believe that he is sending money to England, Holland, and
    Hamburg.</p>
<p>We no longer know here what a Court is. No ladies come
    to see me, because I will not allow them to present themselves
    before me as they do before Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans, with scarfs,
    and no bodies to their loose gowns. Those are things that
    I will not tolerate. I prefer to see no one at all than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> permit such familiarities. Mme. d&rsquo;Orléans has spoilt these
    women; she does not make herself respected and does not
    really know what rank is. Mmes. de Montesson and de
    Maintenon, who brought her up, did not know either. She
    is too proud to be willing to learn anything from me; she
    thinks it would be beneath her, believing herself far superior
    to me when she sees how her room is filled and mine is
    empty. She would not imitate me, neither would I imitate
    her; and so each of us keeps to her own way.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, May, 1720.<br />
</p>
<p>My son has been obliged to dismiss Law, who has hitherto
    been adored as a god. He is no longer controller-general,
    though still the director of the Bank and the Company of
    the Indies. They are obliged to give him a guard, for his
    life is not safe; and it is pitiable to see how great his terror
    is. All sorts of satires are being written and spread about
    him.</p>
<p>The jewellers refuse to work; they value their merchandise
    at three times the price it can now bring on account
    of paper-money. I have often wished that hell-fire would
    burn up those bank-bills. They give my son more trouble
    than comfort. There is no describing all the results they
    have brought about. My son spares himself no trouble,
    but after working from morning till night he likes to amuse
    himself at supper with his little black crow [the regent&rsquo;s
    name for Mme. de Parabère].</p>
<p>According to public clamour things are going horribly
    ill. I wish Law had been at the devil with his system, and
    had never set foot in France. The people do me too much
    honour in saying that if my advice had been listened to
    things would have gone better; I have no advice to give
    in matters concerning the government; I meddle in nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> of the kind. But Frenchmen are so accustomed to see
    women with their fingers in everything that it seems to
    them impossible that I should be aloof from what happens.
    The good Parisians, with whom I am in favour, choose to
    attribute to me whatever is good; I am very much obliged
    to those poor souls for the affection they feel to me, but I
    do not deserve it. The Parisians are the best people in the
    world, and if the parliament did not excite them they
    would never revolt. Poor people, they touch me very much,
    for while they shout against Law they do not attack my
    son, and when I passed in my carriage through the crowd
    they called out benedictions. That touched me so much
    I could not help crying. It is not surprising that they do
    not like my son as much as they do me, for his enemies
    spare nothing to decry him and make him out a reprobate
    and a tyrant; whereas he is really the best man in the
    world&mdash;he is too good. I have never understood the
    system of M. Law, but I have firmly believed that no
    good would come of it. As I cannot disguise my thoughts
    I have always told my son plainly what I think of it. He
    assured me I was mistaken and he wanted to explain the
    matter to me; but the more he tried to make me comprehend
    it, the less I could understand a word of it.</p>
<p>Law is like a dead man, pale as linen; he cannot get over
    that last fright of his. His good friend, the Duc d&rsquo;Antin,
    wants to get his place as director of the Bank. No one
    was ever more terrified than M. Law; my son, who is not
    intimidated in spite of the threats addressed to him, laughs
    till he makes himself ill over Law&rsquo;s cowardice. Though
    everything at present is quiet here, Law does not dare go
    out; the market-women have placed spies round his house
    to know if he leaves it, which bodes no good to him, and
    I fear some new disturbance. But I never in my life knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> an Englishman or a Scotchman so cowardly as Law; it is
    the possession of fortune that destroys courage; men do not
    willingly give up wealth.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1720.<br />
</p>
<p>For the last week I have had a number of letters threatening
    to burn me at Saint-Cloud and my son in the Palais-Royal.
    My son never tells me a word of such things; he
    follows the example of his father, who used to say: &ldquo;It
    is all well, provided Madame knows nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Law has gone to Brussels. Mme. de Prie [M. le Duc&rsquo;s
    mistress] lent him her post-chaise; in returning it he wrote
    to thank her, and sent her a ring worth a hundred thousand
    francs. M. le Duc had given him relays and sent four of
    his servants with him. On taking leave of my son Law
    said to him: &ldquo;Monseigneur, I have made great mistakes;
    I made them because I was human; but you will find
    neither malice nor dishonesty in my conduct.&rdquo; His wife
    would not leave Paris till all their debts were paid; he
    owed his provision man alone ten thousand francs.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1720.<br />
</p>
<p>I am firmly persuaded that my days are counted, but I
    do not occupy my mind with that thought for a moment.
    I place all in the hands of Almighty God, and do not
    give myself any anxiety as to what may come to me;
    for it would indeed be great folly in men and women to
    imagine that human beings are not equal before God, and
    that He would do special things for any of them. I have
    not, thanks to God, either such presumption or such pride. I
    know who I am and I do not deceive myself in that respect.</p>
<p>I am irritated when I look back and think how ill they
    speak of the late king, and how little his Majesty has been
    regretted by those to whom he did most good.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>
<p>The daughter whom he loved best was the tall Princesse
    de Conti. She did not stand ill with the Maintenon; who
    thought it an honour to herself to pay attentions to the
    princess, who had always led a regular life and renounced
    frivolity. She lived at last in great devotion, and when
    they told her that death was near she said: &ldquo;Dying is the
    smallest event of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king often complained that in his youth he had
    never been allowed to mingle with people and converse
    with them. But that is a matter of nature, for Monsieur,
    who was brought up with the king, was always ready to
    talk with anybody. The king said, laughing, that Monsieur&rsquo;s
    gabble had disgusted him with speech. &ldquo;Good
    God!&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;must I, in order to please people,
    talk such paltry and silly nonsense as my brother?&rdquo; It is
    true, however, that Monsieur was more beloved in Paris
    than the king on account of his affability. But when the
    king wanted to please any one he had the most seductive
    manners in the world, and he could win hearts much better
    than my husband. Monsieur (and it is the same with my
    son), was very amiable to everybody, but he did not distinguish
    persons sufficiently; he only showed regard to
    those who liked the Chevalier de Lorraine and his other
    favourites.</p>
<p>After Monsieur&rsquo;s death the king sent to ask me where I
    wished to go, whether to a convent in Paris or to Montargis,
    or elsewhere. I answered that as I had the honour to
    belong to the royal family I could not wish for any other
    residence than that of the king, and I wished to go at once
    to Versailles. That pleased him; he came to see me; but
    he rather piqued me by saying that he had not thought I
    should wish to stay in the same place with himself. I
    replied I did not know who could have made to his Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> such false reports about me, and that I had more respect and
    attachment to him than those who had accused me falsely.
    Then the king made every one leave the room and we had
    a grand explanation, in which the king reproached me for
    hating Mme. de Maintenon. I said it was true that I hated
    her, but it was only out of attachment to him, and because of
    the evil offices she did me with him; nevertheless, I added,
    if it would be agreeable to him that I should be reconciled
    with her I was ready to be so. The good lady had not foreseen
    that, otherwise she would never have let the king come
    near me; but he was acting in such good faith that he continued
    friendly to me to his last hour. He sent for the old
    woman and said to her: &ldquo;Madame is very willing to be
    reconciled with you;&rdquo; he made us embrace and the affair
    ended that way. Ever after he wished her to live on good
    terms with me; which she did outwardly, but she played
    me, underhand, all sorts of tricks. I should not have
    minded making a trip to Montargis, but I did not want it
    to look like a disgrace,&mdash;as if I had done something to deserve
    being sent from Court. There was also danger that I
    should be left there to die of hunger; I much preferred to be
    reconciled with the king. As for retiring to a convent, that
    was not at all my reckoning&mdash;though it was just what the
    old woman would have liked to make me do. The château
    de Montargis is my dower-house; at Orléans there is no
    house; Saint-Cloud is not an appanage, it is private property
    which Monsieur bought with his own money. Now my
    dower is nothing; all that I have to live upon comes from
    the king and my son. At the beginning of my widowhood
    I was left without a penny till they finally owed me three
    hundred thousand francs which was never paid till after the
    king&rsquo;s death. What would have become of me, therefore,
    had I chosen Montargis for my residence?</p>

<p>The king forgot La Vallière as completely as if he had
    never seen her or known her in his life. She had as many
    virtues as the Montespan had vices. The sole weakness that
    she had for the king was very excusable. The king was
    young, gallant, and handsome; she herself very young; all
    the world led her and drove her to her fault. At bottom
    she was modest and virtuous, with a most kind heart. I
    told her sometimes that she had transposed her love and
    carried to God just that which she had for the king. They
    did her the utmost injustice in accusing her of loving any
    one but the king&mdash;but lies cost the Montespan nothing.
    It was at her instigation that the king so ill-treated La
    Vallière. The poor creature&rsquo;s heart was pierced; but she
    fancied she was offering the greatest sacrifice to God in
    immolating to him the source of her sin on the very spot
    where the sin was committed. Therefore, she stayed on, as
    penance, with the Montespan. The latter, who had more
    cleverness, laughed at her publicly, treated her ill, and made
    the king do likewise. Yet she bore it with patience.</p>
<p>Her glance had a charm that can never be described; she
    had a graceful figure, but her teeth were vile; her eyes
    seemed to me much more beautiful than those of Mme. de
    Montespan; her whole bearing was modesty itself. She
    limped slightly, but it was not unbecoming. When the
    king made her a duchess and legitimatized her children she
    was in despair, for she thought till then that no one knew
    she had them. When I came to France she had not yet
    retired to a convent; in fact, she remained two years longer
    at Court. We became intimately acquainted at the time
    she took the veil. I was greatly touched to see that charming
    creature persist in her resolution, and when they put
    her beneath the pall I wept so bitterly I could not see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> rest. When the ceremony was over she came to me to comfort
    me, and told me that I ought to congratulate her and
    not pity her because she was beginning, from that instant, to
    be happy; she said she should never in her life forget the
    favour and friendship I had shown to her, which she
    had never deserved to receive from me. Shortly after, I
    went to see her again; I was curious to know why she had
    remained so long as a servant to the Montespan. God, she
    told me, had touched her heart, and had given her to know
    her sin; she then thought that she ought to do penance and
    suffer in the way most painful to her,&mdash;that of sharing the
    king&rsquo;s heart with another, and seeing him despise her. During
    the three years that the king&rsquo;s love was ceasing she had
    suffered like a lost soul, and had offered to God her sorrow
    in expiation of her past sin, because, having sinned publicly,
    she thought her repentance should be public also. They had
    taken her, she said, for a silly fool who noticed nothing, and
    it was precisely then that she suffered most, until God put
    into her mind to leave all and serve Him only, which she
    had now done, although on account of her vices she was not
    worthy to live among the pure and pious souls of the other
    Carmelites. I saw that what she said came from the depths
    of her spirit.</p>
<p>You tell me that you are never fatigued listening to your
    two preachers. I must confess to my shame that I know
    nothing more wearisome than a sermon; opium could not
    make me sleep more soundly. I cannot go to church in the
    afternoon, for I fall asleep at once; and as I am not in a pew
    here, but facing the pulpit in an armchair where everybody
    sees me, it would be a real scandal. Besides, since I have
    grown old, I snore very loud, which would make people
    laugh, and the preacher himself might be disconcerted.</p>
<p>I have three fine Bibles: that of Mérian, which my aunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> the Abbess of Maubuisson, bequeathed to me; an edition of
    Luneburg which is very fine, and another sent to me last
    year by the Princess of Oldenbourg. The latter is like me,
    short and thick, and neither the print nor the engravings are
    as good as in the two others. When I came to France every
    one was forbidden to read the Bible; for the last few years
    it has been permitted, but lately the Constitution (Unigenitus),
    about which there has been so much talk, has again
    forbidden it. It is true no one minds the injunction. As
    for me, I laugh and say I am perfectly willing to obey the
    Constitution, and will bind myself to read no French Bible;
    in fact, I never open any but my German ones. The Bible
    is good and wholesome nourishment; and what is more, very
    agreeable. But the German Catholics never have recourse
    to it, they are so inclined to superstition.</p>
<p>When a person has lived like M. Leibnitz I cannot believe
    that he needs to have priests about him; they can teach him
    nothing, for he knows more than they. Habit does not form
    a true fear of God, and the communion, considered as the
    result of habit, has no moral value if the heart is devoid of
    praiseworthy feelings. I do not doubt M. Leibnitz&rsquo;s salvation,
    and I think he is very fortunate not to have suffered
    longer.</p>
<p>I know a person who has been the very intimate friend of
    a learned abbé That abbé knew most particularly well the
    celebrated Descartes at the time when he was living in
    Amsterdam, before he went to Sweden to visit Queen Christina.
    The abbé often told my friend that Descartes used to
    laugh at his own system and say: &ldquo;I have cut them out a
    fine piece of work; we&rsquo;ll see who will be fool enough to
    take hold of it&rdquo; [or &ldquo;be taken in by it.&rdquo; <i>Je leur ai taillé de
    la besogne; nous verrons qui sera assez sot pour y donner</i>].</p>
<p>I have seen that other philosopher, M. de La Mothe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> Vayer; with all his talent he scurried along like a crazy
    man. He always wore furred boots and a cap lined with
    fur, which he never took off, very broad neck-bands, and a
    velvet coat.</p>
<p>As long as I was at Heidelberg I never read a novel; his
    Highness, my father, would not let me do so; but since I
    have been here I have compensated myself finely. There
    are none that I have not read: &ldquo;Astrée,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cléopatre,&rdquo; &ldquo;Aléfie,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Cassandre,&rdquo; &ldquo;Poliesandre&rdquo; [Madame&rsquo;s own spelling].
    Besides which I have read lesser ones: &ldquo;Tarcis et Célie,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Lissandre et Calixte,&rdquo; &ldquo;Caloandro,&rdquo; &ldquo;Endimiro,&rdquo; &ldquo;Amadis&rdquo;
    (but as to the last I only got as far as the seventeenth volume,
    and there are twenty-four); also the &ldquo;Roman des
    Romans,&rdquo; &ldquo;Théagène and Chariclée,&rdquo; of which there are
    pictures at Fontainebleau in the king&rsquo;s cabinet.</p>
<p>The monks of Saint-Mihiel have the original of the &ldquo;Memoirs
    of Cardinal de Retz,&rdquo; and they have printed and sold
    them at Nancy. Many things are lacking in that edition.
    But Mme. de Caumartin, who possesses the memoirs in manuscript,
    where not a word is missing, is obstinate in not
    letting them be seen, so that the work is incomplete.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Saint-Cloud</span>, 1720.<br />

<p>I think that Madame [her predecessor] was more wronged
    than wronging; she had to do with very wicked people,
    about whom I could tell many things if I chose. Madame
    was very young, beautiful, agreeable, and full of grace, and
    surrounded by the greatest coquettes in the world, the mistresses
    of Madame&rsquo;s enemies, who sought only to get her into
    trouble and make Monsieur quarrel with her. They say
    here that she was not handsome; but she had so much grace
    that everything became her. She was not capable of forgiving,
    and was determined to drive away the Chevalier de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> Lorraine. In that she succeeded, but it cost her her life.
    He sent the poison from Italy by a Provençal gentleman
    named Morel, and to reward the latter he was made chief <i>maître-d&rsquo;hôtel</i>. He robbed and pillaged me and was made to
    sell his office, for which he got a high price. This Morel had
    the cleverness of a devil, but knew neither law nor gospel.
    He owned to me himself that he believed in nothing. When
    he was dying he would not hear of God, and said of himself,
    &ldquo;Let this carcass alone; it is good for nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is very true that Madame was poisoned, but without
    Monsieur&rsquo;s knowledge. When those scoundrels held counsel
    with one another to determine how they should poison poor
    Madame, they discussed whether or not they should warn
    Monsieur. The Chevalier de Lorraine said, &ldquo;No, do not let
    us tell him, for he cannot hold his tongue. If he does not
    speak of it the first year, he will get us hanged ten years
    later.&rdquo; And it is known that one of the wretches added,
    &ldquo;Be careful not to let Monsieur know of it; he would tell
    it to the king, and that would hang us.&rdquo; They made
    Monsieur believe that the Dutch had given Madame a slow
    poison in chocolate: but here is the truth:&mdash;</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Effiat did not poison the chicory water, but he poisoned
    Madame&rsquo;s cup; and that was well imagined, because no one
    drinks from our cups but ourselves. The cup was not
    brought out as soon as asked for; they said it was mislaid.
    A <i>valet de chambre</i> whom I had, and who had been in the
    service of the late Madame (he is dead now), related to me
    that in the morning, while Monsieur and Madame were at
    mass, d&rsquo;Effiat went to the buffet, found the cup, and rubbed
    it with some paper. The <i>valet de chambre</i> said to him:
    &ldquo;Monsieur, what are you doing in our closet, and why are
    you touching Madame&rsquo;s cup?&rdquo; He answered: &ldquo;I am dying
    of thirst, and as the cup was dirty I cleaned it with paper.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> That evening Madame asked for her chicory water, and
    as soon as she drank it she cried out that she was poisoned.
    Those who were there had drunk of the same water, but not
    from her cup, and they were not taken ill. They put her to
    bed, and she grew worse and worse, and died two hours after
    midnight in frightful suffering.</p>
<p>Monsieur never troubled his wife about her gallantries
    with the king his brother; he himself related to me the
    whole of Madame&rsquo;s life, and he never would have passed
    that matter over in silence had he believed it. I think that
    as to this circumstance the world has been unjust to Madame.</p>
<p>For many years a rumour has spread about Saint-Cloud
    that the ghost of the late Madame appeared about a fountain
    where she used to sit in very warm weather, because the
    place was cool. One evening a lacquey of the Maréchale de
    Clérembault, going to draw water at the well, saw something
    white without a face; the phantom, which was sitting
    down, rose to double its height. The poor lacquey, seized
    with fright, ran away; on reaching the house he insisted
    that he had seen Madame, fell ill and died. The officer
    who was then captain of the château, imagining that there
    must be something under it all, went to the fountain himself,
    saw the ghost, and threatened to give it a hundred
    blows with his stick if it did not own who it was. Whereupon
    the ghost said: &ldquo;Oh! Monsieur de Lastéra, don&rsquo;t hurt
    me, I am only poor Philippinette.&rdquo; She was an old woman
    in the village, about seventy-seven years old, with only one
    tooth in her mouth, weak eyes rimmed with red, a huge
    mouth, a thick nose,&mdash;in short, hideous. They wanted to
    put her in prison, but I interceded for her. When she came
    to thank me for that I said to her: &ldquo;What mania possessed
    you to play the ghost instead of staying in your bed?&rdquo;
    She answered, laughing: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret what I have done;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> at my age one sleeps little, and one must have something
    or other to keep one&rsquo;s spirits up. All I ever did in my
    youth did not give me as much enjoyment as playing the
    ghost. Those who were not afraid of my white sheet were
    afraid of my face. The cowards made such faces I nearly
    died of laughing. That pleasure at night paid me for the
    pain of carrying faggots by day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I feel a bitter grief whenever I think of all M. Louvois
    burned in the Palatinate, and I believe he is burning terribly
    in the other world, for he died so suddenly he had no time
    to repent. He was poisoned by his doctor, who was afterwards
    poisoned himself, but confessed his crime before he
    died, with all details and circumstances, so that there could
    be no doubt about it. As he was a friend of the old woman,
    it was given out that he died in a spasm of hot fever. Thus
    we see, if we examine things well, the justice of God;
    people are usually punished in this world by their own
    sins.</p>
<p>The longer I live the more reason I have to regret my
    aunt, the Electress, and to respect her memory. You are
    very right in saying that in many centuries we shall not see
    her like again. Unhappily, I lack a great deal of having
    her judgment and her energy. What may be praised in
    me is frankness and good-will; and, thank God, I am not
    licentious, as is now the fashion among the princely people
    of the royal house of France.</p>

<p>Rhine wine was <i>never</i> put into the great tun at Heidelberg;
    only Neckar wine. The present Elector is said not to hate
    it. As for me, Rhine wine is what I prefer. I cannot endure
    Burgundy; the taste seems to me disagreeable, and
    besides, it gives me a stomach-ache. I am delighted that
    Heidelberg is being rebuilt, and that they are working on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> the château; but what vexes me is that they are putting up
    a Jesuit convent instead of the commissariat. Jesuits are
    out of place at Heidelberg, and so are the Franciscans. I
    am told they live now near to the upper gate; my God!
    how often I have eaten cherries on that mountain, with a
    good bit of bread, at five in the morning! I was gayer then
    than I am now.</p>
<p>You know how the pope had Lord Peterborough arrested
    at Bologna, nobody knows why. He went about disguised
    as a woman; with great talents he behaves like a madman.
    He says he will not come out of prison till he obtains reparation
    for the affront put upon him. For my part, if I were
    in prison and they gave me leave to get out, I should depart
    as fast as possible and say what I had to say later,&mdash;first of
    all, I should recover my liberty. This lord is the queerest
    eccentric. I think he would rather die than deprive himself
    of saying what comes into his head and of doing malicious
    things to the persons he dislikes.</p>

<p>For forty years no October has ever passed without my son
    being ill, one way or another, about the 22nd of the month.
    Though he is regent he never appears before me or leaves
    me without kissing my hand before I embrace him. He
    never takes a chair in my presence; but in other respects he
    stands on no ceremony and gabbles as he likes; we laugh
    and joke together like cronies. Between him and his mistresses
    everything goes on to beat of drum without the least
    gallantry; it reminds me of those old patriarchs who had so
    many women. The Duc de Saint-Simon was impatient one
    day with some of my son&rsquo;s easy-going ways and said to him,
    angrily: &ldquo;Oh! you are so <i>debonnaire</i>! since the days of
    Louis le Debonnaire there has never been any one so easy-going
    as you.&rdquo; My son nearly died of laughter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p>My son believes in predestination as much as if he had
    belonged, like me, for nineteen years to the Reformed religion.
    What seems to me strange is that he does not hate his
    brother-in-law, the lamester, who would like to see him dead.
    I think there never was his like; there is no gall in him; I
    never knew him to hate any one.</p>
<p>Mme. la Duchesse is very amusing and says the most
    diverting things. She is fond of good eating; and that was
    just what suited the dauphin [Monseigneur]; he went to
    her every morning for a good breakfast, and at night for a
    collation. Her daughters had the same tastes, so that Monseigneur
    spent the whole day in a society that amused him.
    At first he was attached to his daughter-in-law [the Duchesse
    de Bourgogne], but after she quarrelled with Mme. la
    Duchesse he completely changed; and what irritated him
    still more was that the Duchesse de Bourgogne brought
    about the marriage of his son, the Duc de Berry, a marriage
    he did not like. He was not wrong in that, and they did
    not treat him well in the matter, I must allow, though the
    marriage was greatly to our advantage.</p>
<p>The Queen of Spain [Marie-Louise de Savoie] remained
    much longer with her mother than our dauphine, her sister;
    consequently, she was very much better educated. The
    Maintenon knew nothing about education; to win the young
    dauphine&rsquo;s affection and keep it for herself alone, she let her
    do just what she liked. The young girl had been brought
    up by her virtuous mother, and was very winning and droll;
    merriness became her; she was not ugly when she had a fine
    colour. I could not tell you what foolish heads were allowed
    to surround the young princess; for example, the Maréchale
    d&rsquo;Estrées. The Maintenon was well paid for giving her
    such senseless animals, for the result was that she ceased
    to care for her society. But the Maintenon, determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> know the cause, tormented the princess to admit it. Finally
    the dauphine told her that the Maréchale d&rsquo;Estrées was daily
    saying to her, &ldquo;Why do you stay with the old woman, and
    not with those who can amuse you much better than that
    old carcass?&rdquo;&mdash;saying also other evil things of her. The
    Maintenon told me this herself after the dauphine&rsquo;s death,
    to prove it was solely the fault of that hussy that the dauphine
    did not live on good terms with me. That might be
    half true, but it is none the less certain that the old <i>vilaine</i> had set her against me. Nearly all the giddy young women
    who surrounded the dauphine were relations or allies of the
    old woman; it was by her orders that they tried to amuse
    and divert the princess,&mdash;in order that she might have no
    other society than what she gave her, and be bored elsewhere.</p>
<p>But when the dauphine reached years of discretion she corrected
    herself in a wonderful manner, and repented heartily
    of her childish follies; which showed she had judgment.
    What corrected her was the marriage of Mme. de Berry.
    She saw that that young woman made others dislike her,
    and that all went wrong; she then desired to adopt another
    behaviour than that of her cousin, and to make herself respected.
    Accordingly she changed her conduct completely;
    retired within herself, and became as sensible as she had
    previously been too little so. She had much judgment; she
    knew her faults perfectly well, and she knew also how to
    correct them in a wonderful way. She changed her way of
    life, and in one month she brought back to her side all those
    whom she had caused to dislike her. Thus she continued
    until her death. She said frankly how much she regretted
    to have been so giddy; but excused herself on the ground
    of her extreme youth, and she blamed the young women
    who had set her such a bad example and given her such
    bad advice. She gave them public marks of her displeasure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> and managed matters so that the king did not take them
    any longer to Marly. In this way she brought every one
    back to her.</p>
<p>She was delicate in health and even sickly. But Doctor
    Chirac assured us until the last that she would recover.
    And it is true that if they had not let her get up whilst she
    had the measles, and had not bled her in the foot, she would
    now be living. Immediately after the bleeding, from being
    red as fire she became pale as death and felt extremely ill.
    When they took her out of her bed I cried out that they
    ought to let the sweating subside before they bled her.
    Chirac and Fagon were obstinate and only scoffed at me.
    The old <i>guenipe</i> came up to me and said: &ldquo;Do you think
    yourself cleverer than all the doctors who are here?&rdquo; I
    replied, &ldquo;No, madame, but it does not take much cleverness
    to know that we ought to follow nature, and if nature inclines
    to sweating it would be better to follow that indication
    than to take a sick person up in a perspiration to bleed her.&rdquo;
    She shrugged her shoulders and smiled ironically. I went
    to the other side of the room and never said another word.</p>
<p>The Maintenon always retained the fire of her eyes; but
    she pinched her lips and contracted her nostrils, which gave
    her the very disagreeable air she put on when she saw any
    one who displeased her, my Excellency for instance; at such
    times she would raise the corners of her mouth and drop
    her under lip. I have often heard her say in a jesting way,
    &ldquo;I have been too far from, and too near grandeur to know
    what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I grow weaker and can hardly hold my pen, but there is
    nothing to be done. I place myself in the hands of God
    and refer all things to His will. I think I shall end by
    drying up, like that tortoise I kept at Heidelberg in my bedroom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> But as long as I live be sure, dear Louise, that my

<p>There is not in all the world a better air than that of
    Heidelberg, especially that about the château near my bedroom;
    nothing finer can be found. No one understands

    something droll to tell me which makes me laugh; he has
    wit and expresses himself charmingly. I should be a most
    unnatural mother if I did not love him from the bottom of
    my heart; if you knew him you would see that he has no
    ambition and no malignity. Ah! my God, he is only too
    kind; he pardons all that is done against him and laughs
    about it. If he would only show his teeth to his wicked relations
    they would learn to fear him and cease their horrible
    machinations. You cannot imagine the wickedness and the
    ambition of the third prince of the blood. As long as M.
    le Duc hoped to get money out of my son he overwhelmed
    him with protestations of attachment and devotion; now
    that there is nothing more to get from him he has turned
    completely against him and has joined my son&rsquo;s inhuman
    enemy, the Prince de Conti.</p>

<p>I am coming to the close of my seventieth year, and I
    feel that if I have another shock like that which struck me
    so severely last year I shall soon know how things go on in
    the other world. My constitution continues sound, as may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> be seen by the fact that I have resisted all attacks, but, as
    the French proverb says, &ldquo;the pitcher may go once too often
    to the well;&rdquo; and that is what will happen to me in the
    end. But these thoughts do not trouble me, for we know
    that we come into this world only to die. I do not think
    that extreme old age is a pleasant thing; there is too much
    to suffer; and with regard to physical suffering I am a great
    coward.</p>
<p>Saint François de Sales, who founded the Order of the
    Filles de Sainte-Marie, was in his youth a friend of the
    Maréchal de Villeroy, father of the present marshal.
    The marshal never could bring himself to give him his
    name as a saint, and when they spoke to him of his friend
    he used to say: &ldquo;I was delighted when I heard that M. de
    Sales was a saint; he liked smutty stories and cheated at
    cards; the best man in the world in other respects, but a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I follow the fashions at a distance, and some of them I
    put aside entirely, such as paniers, which I do not wear, and
    loose gowns, which I cannot abide and will not permit in
    my presence. I think them indecent; women look as if
    they had just got out of their beds. There is no rule here
    now about the fashions. Tailors, dressmakers, and hairdressers
    invent what they please. I have never followed to
    excess the fashion of tall head-dresses.</p>
<p>I do not know what you mean about your neighbours the
    storks never failing to come back every year. We have
    none in France, and I wish you would tell me if you see
    them in England; for it is said they never stay in any
    kingdom.</p>

<p>All that we read in the Bible about the excesses which
    were punished by the Deluge, and about the lewdness of
    Sodom and Gomorrah does not approach the life now led in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> Paris. Out of nine young men of rank who dined the other
    day with my grandson, the Duc de Chartres, seven had the
    French disease. Is it not horrible? The majority of the
    people here are occupied solely with their pleasures and
    debauchery; outside of that they know nothing and care
    for nothing; they do not believe in a future life; they
    imagine that they will end in death.</p>
<p>The Abbé Dubois sends me word he has nothing now to
    do with the post, which concerns exclusively M. de Torcy;
    they are rotten eggs and rancid butter, the pair of them;
    one is no better than the other, and both would be more in
    their place on a gibbet than at Court, for they are not worth
    the devil and are more treacherous than gallows-wood, as
    Lenore would say. If they have the curiosity to read this
    letter they will see the eulogy I make upon them, and they
    will recognize the truth of our German proverb, &ldquo;Listeners
    never hear any good of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know very well that we pay the postage on letters we
    receive, but as to paying for those we put in the post, that is
    something new; I never heard of it before in all my life.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Cambrai [Dubois] is coming here to-day
    to tell me of his elevation to the cardinalate; so
    Alberoni has got a comrade. He is one I cannot love; he
    poisoned my whole life; at the same time I would not do
    him any harm. May God forgive him, but he may suffer
    for it in this world.</p>
<p>We are all in full dress for the ceremony of his reception
    at three o&rsquo;clock; I shall be obliged to bow to him, and make
    him sit down, and talk to him a few moments. It will
    not be without pain; but pain and vexation are one&rsquo;s daily
    bread&mdash;but here comes the cardinal, and I must pause.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>The cardinal has begged me to forget the past; he has
    made me the finest harangue that was ever listened to.
    He has great capacities,&mdash;that is undeniable; and if he
    were only as honest as he is capable, he would leave nothing
    to be desired.</p>

<p>I can only write you a few words and in all haste this
    morning, my dear Louise, for I am going to Paris to compliment
    my son and his wife on the good news they have
    just received and transmitted to me instantly. The King
    of Spain has asked their daughter in marriage for his son
    the Prince of the Asturias. Mlle. de Montpensier has no
    name as yet, but before she goes to Spain the ceremony will
    be performed; the king and I are to name her; she will
    then make her first communion and be confirmed; that is
    what may be called receiving the three sacraments together.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1721.<br />
</p>
<p>They leave me no peace; visitors at every moment; I
    am obliged to get up and make conversation. First came
    the Comte de Clermont, third brother of M. le Duc; after
    him the Duchesse de Ventadour and her sister the Duchesse
    de La Ferté; then the Duc de Chartres, his three sisters
    and their governess, my two ladies, and Mme. de Ségur,
    my son&rsquo;s daughter by the left side and not legitimatized.
    That made twelve at table. Then came the Maréchale de
    Clérembault and Cardinal de Gèsvres; I had to rise to
    receive him and talk to him. But all that is not comparable
    to what awaited me after dinner from two o&rsquo;clock to
    half-past six. I found in my salon Mme. la Princesse, with
    our Duchess of Hanover, the tall Princesse de Conti, and
    Mlle. de Clermont, with all their ladies; and when they
    went away the little Princesse de Conti came with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> daughter; then the Duchesse du Maine, Mme. la Duchesse
    and her daughter, and all their ladies. Also a great many
    other ladies not of the royal family, such as the Princesse
    d&rsquo;Espinoy, the Duchesse de Valentinois, the Princesse de
    Montauban, and I don&rsquo;t know who else, innumerable duchesses,
    the Maréchales de Noailles and de Boufflers, the
    Duchesses de Lesdiguières, de Nevers, d&rsquo;Humières, de Grammont,
    de Roquelaire, de Villars; the Duchesse d&rsquo;Orléans
    came too; as for the ladies who did not sit, they were
    innumerable, and I am quite sure I have forgotten some of
    the <i>tabouret</i> ones. It was so hot in my room that I should
    have fainted if I had not gone, now and then, into my
    dressing-room to get a breath of air. But what made me
    suffer most was my knees; by dint of rising and bowing
    I really thought I should faint away.</p>
<p>I have an abbé (whom I often call a scamp) sitting by
    me now; he is dinning his chatter into my ears so that I
    really do not know what I write; from that, you will know
    very well that I mean my Abbé de Saint Albin, who will
    soon be Bishop of Laon, duke and peer of France. That will
    give me great pleasure, because I have felt more attachment
    for that poor boy from his earliest childhood than for all his
    brothers and sisters; I feel that of all my son&rsquo;s children,
    legitimate and illegitimate, he is the one that I love best.</p>
<p>My son cannot and will not believe that the Duc du
    Maine is the king&rsquo;s son. That man has always been treacherous;
    he did ill-turns to everybody; he was always hated
    as an arch-spy and informer. His wife, the little frog, is
    much more violent than he; for he is cowardly, and fear
    restrains him; but the wife mingles the heroic with her
    capers. I think myself that the Comte de Toulouse is really
    the king&rsquo;s son; but I have always believed that the Duc
    du Maine was the son of Terme, who was a treacherous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> scoundrel and the worst spy at Court. The old <i>guenipe</i> had persuaded the king that the Duc du Maine was all
    virtue and piety; and when he reported harm of any
    one, she said it was for that person&rsquo;s good, so that the
    king might correct him. Thus the king considered everything
    that came from du Maine admirable; he regarded
    him as a saint. To this that confessor, Père Tellier, contributed
    much in order to please the old woman. The late
    chancellor Voysin also talked about the duke to the king
    by order of the Maintenon.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1721.<br />
</p>
<p>It cannot be said that Mlle. de Montpensier is ugly;
    she has pretty eyes, a delicate white skin, a well-formed
    nose, though rather too slim, and a very small mouth;
    and yet with all that she is the most disagreeable person
    I ever saw in my life; in all her actions, speaking, eating,
    drinking, she is intolerable; she did not shed a tear in
    leaving us; in fact, she scarcely said farewell.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I have
    seen successively two of my relatives and now my grand-daughter
    become Queens of Spain. The one I loved best
    was my step-daughter [wife of Charles II.]; for her I had
    a most sincere affection as if she were my sister; she could
    not have been my daughter because I was only nine years
    older than she. I was still very childish when I came to
    France, and we used to play together with Charles-Louis
    and the little Prince d&rsquo;Eisenach, and make such a racket
    you could not have heard a thunderbolt fall.</p>

    for instance: &ldquo;They say that those who die at my age are
    saved and go straight to paradise; I should therefore be
    very glad if the good God would take me.&rdquo; I fear she has
    too much mind, and will not live. She has the prettiest
    ways in the world; she has taken a great liking to me, and
    runs to me in her antechamber with her arms wide open,
    and kisses me with affection. I am not on bad terms with
    the little king.</p>

<p>I returned here the day before yesterday; but in a sad
    state.</p>
<p>During my journey I received five of your good letters,
    dear Louise, and I thank you most sincerely, for they gave
    me great pleasure. I could not answer them, as much on
    account of my weakness as from the perpetual bustle in
    which I was. My time was all taken up by the ceremonies,
    by my children whom I had constantly about me, and by a
    crowd of distinguished persons, princes, dukes, cardinals,
    archbishops, and bishops who came to see me. I think that
    in the whole world nothing more magnificent could be
    imagined than the coronation of the king; if God allows
    me a little health I will write you a description of it. My
    daughter was much moved at seeing me. She scarcely
    believed in my illness, and fancied it was only a little over-fatigue.
    But when she saw me at Reims she was so shocked
    that the tears came into her eyes, and that pained me very
    much.</p>
<p>I wish I could talk with you longer, but I feel too weak.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig">November 12, 1722.<br />
</p>
<p>I hope to send you to-morrow a grand account of the
    coronation. I know nothing new, except that I have been
    told one thing which causes me the greatest joy. My son
    has broken from his mistresses, thinking that he ought not
    to continue a style of life which would be a bad example
    to the king and draw down upon him just condemnation.
    May God maintain him in these good intentions and order
    all things for his happiness; that is the only thing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> which I am solicitous; I have no anxiety as to what God
    may do with me.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig">November 21, 1722.<br />
</p>
<p>I grow worse hour by hour, and I suffer day and night;
    nothing that they do for me relieves me. I have great need
    that God should inspire me with patience; He would do
    me a great mercy if He delivered me from my sufferings;
    therefore do not be distressed if you lose me; it will be a
    great blessing for me.</p>
<p>In addition to my own illness I have another thing that
    goes to my heart; my poor old Maréchale de Clérembault is
    very ill.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig">November 29, 1722.<br />
</p>
<p>You will receive to-day but a very short letter; I am
    worse than I have ever been, and have not closed my eyes
    all night. Yesterday morning we lost our poor maréchale;
    she had no attack, but life appeared to abandon her. It
    gives me sincere pain; she was a lady of great capacity and
    much merit; she was highly educated, though she did not
    make it apparent. They tell me she has chosen as her heir
    the son of her eldest brother. It is not surprising that a
    person eighty-eight years of age should go; but, even so, it is
    painful to lose a friend with whom one has passed fifty-one
    years of one&rsquo;s life. But I must stop, my dear Louise;
    I suffer too much to say more to-day. If you could see the
    state in which I am you would understand how much I
    wish that it might end.</p>

<h2>VI.</h2>
<h3>LETTERS OF THE DUCHESSE DE BOURGOGNE.</h3>
<h3 class="mf">PRECEDED BY REMARKS OF</h3>
<h3>C.-A. SAINTE-BEUVE.</h3>
<p>Marie-Adélaïde de Savoie, Duchesse de Bourgogne,
    who was married to the grandson of Louis XIV. and was
    the mother of Louis XV., has left a very gracious memory
    behind her. She flitted through the world like one of those
    bright, rapid apparitions which the imagination of contemporaries
    delights to embellish. Born in 1685, daughter of
    the Duc de Savoie, who transmitted to her his ability and
    possibly his craft, grand-daughter by her mother of that
    amiable Henrietta of England (first wife of Monsieur, Louis
    XIV.&rsquo;s brother), whose death Bossuet immortalized, and
    whose charm she resuscitated, Marie-Adélaïde came to
    France when eleven years old to marry the Duc de Bourgogne,
    who was then thirteen. The marriage took place the
    following year, but in form only; and for several years the
    education of the young princess was the occupation of her
    life. Mme. de Maintenon applied herself to that purpose
    with all the care and consistency of which she was so capable.
    It was not her fault if the Duchesse de Bourgogne did not
    become the most exemplary of the pupils of Saint-Cyr. The
    vivacity and lively spirits of the princess disconcerted at
    times the well-laid schemes of prudence, and she constantly
    broke from the frame in which it was designed to hold her.
    Nevertheless, she profited through it all; serious thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> slipped in among her pleasures. It was for her that sacred
    plays, some by Duché, but especially Racine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Athalie,&rdquo;
    were acted in Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s apartment. In &ldquo;Athalie,&rdquo;
    the Duchesse de Bourgogne played a part.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;"> <img src="images/219.jpg" width="453" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"> <i>The Duchesse de Bourgogne</i></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The princess had already received in Savoie a certain
    education, especially in that so necessary to princes and
    which nature itself gives to women, namely, the desire and
    the effort to please. She arrived at Montargis on Sunday,
    November 4, 1696. Louis XIV. had left Fontainebleau after
    dinner and gone to Montargis with his son [Monseigneur],
    his brother [Monsieur, the little Adélaïde&rsquo;s grandfather], and
    all the principal seigneurs of his Court, in order to receive
    her. Before going to bed that night the king concludes an
    important letter to Mme. de Maintenon in which he gives
    her an account in the fullest detail of the person and slightest
    action of the little princess; it was the affair of State of
    the moment. The original of this letter of Louis XIV. exists
    in the library of the Louvre, and it is here given textually.
    Let us now read Louis XIV. undisguised, or rather, let
    us listen to the great monarch conversing and relating; language
    excellent, phrases neat, exact, and perfect, terms appropriate,
    good taste supreme in all that concerns externals
    and visible appearance; whatever, in short, contributes to
    regal presentation. As for the moral basis, that is slim and
    mediocre enough, we must allow, or rather, it is absent.
    But let us read the letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;I arrived here [Montargis] before five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; writes the
        king; &ldquo;the princess did not come till nearly six. I went to
        receive her at the carriage; she let me speak first, and afterwards
        she replied extremely well, but with a little embarrassment
        that would have pleased you. I led her to her room
        through the crowd, letting her be seen from time to time by
        making the torches come nearer to her face. She bore that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> march and the lights with grace and modesty. At last we
        reached her room, where there was a crowd, and heat enough
        to kill us. I showed her now and then to those who approached
        us, and I considered her in every way in order to
        write you what I think of her. She has the best grace and
        the prettiest figure I have ever seen; dressed to paint, and
        hair the same; eyes very bright and very beautiful, the lashes
        black and admirable; complexion very even, white and red,
        all that one could wish; the finest blond hair that was ever
        seen, and in great quantity. She is thin, but that belongs to
        her years; her mouth is rosy, the lips full, the teeth white,
        long, and ill-placed; the hands well shaped, but the colour of
        her age. She speaks little, so far as I have seen; is not embarrassed
        when looked at, like a person who has seen the
        world. She curtseys badly, with a rather Italian air. She
        has also something of an Italian in her face; but she pleases;
        I saw that in the eyes of those present. As for me, I am
        wholly satisfied. She resembles her first portrait, not the
        second. To speak to you as I always do, I must tell you that
        I find her all that could be wished; I should be sorry if she
        were handsomer.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I say it again: everything is pleasing except the curtsey.
        I will tell you more after supper, for there I shall observe
        many things which I have not been able to see as yet. I forgot
        to tell you that she is short rather than tall for her age.
        Up to this time I have done marvels; I hope I can sustain a
        certain easy air I have taken until we reach Fontainebleau,
        where I greatly desire to find myself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock that night, before going to bed, the king
    added the following postscript:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The more I see of the princess, the more satisfied I am.
        We had a public conversation, in which she said nothing, and
        that is saying all. Her waist is very beautiful, one might
        say perfect, and her modesty would please you. We supped
        and she did not fail in anything, and has a charming politeness
        to every one; but to me and my son she fails in nothing,
        and behaves as you might have done. She was much looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> at and observed; and all present seemed in good faith to be
        satisfied. Her air is noble, her manners polished and agreeable;
        I have pleasure in telling you such good of her, for I
        find that, without prepossession or flattery, I can do so and
        that everything obliges me to do so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, shall I venture to express my thought? There is
    certainly a mention of modesty in one or two places in the
    letter; but it is of the modest <i>air</i>, the good effect produced,
    the grace that depended on it. For all the rest it is impossible
    to find on these pages anything other than a charming
    physical, external, and mundane description, without the
    slightest concern as to inward and moral qualities. Evidently
    the king is as little concerned about those as he is
    deeply anxious about externals. Let the princess succeed
    and please, let her charm and amuse, let her adorn the
    Court and enliven it, give her a good confessor, a sound
    Jesuit, and for all the rest let her be and do what pleases
    her; the king asks nothing else: that is the impression left
    upon me by that letter.</p>
<p>If there had entered into this letter written from Montargis
    even a flash of moral solicitude in the midst of the
    record of those external graces and perfect proprieties, Louis
    XIV. would not have been, after twelve years&rsquo; hourly
    intimacy, the odious and hard grandfather of the scene at
    Marly near the carp basin, to the mother of his expected
    heir. I send the reader for the details and the accessories of
    that singular scene to Saint-Simon, who in this instance is
    our Tacitus, the Tacitus of a king not naturally cruel, but
    who was so that day by force of egotism and selfishness.
    That first letter from Montargis, so elegant, so smiling
    on the outward surface, covered in its depths the vanity
    and egotism of a master, solicitude solely for decorum and
    curtseying&mdash;the scene at the basin of carp concludes it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>I shall not reproduce here the divers portraits of the
    Duchesse de Bourgogne; I should have to take them from
    many sources, but above all from Saint-Simon. She was
    neither handsome nor pretty, she was better than either.
    Each feature of her face taken separately might seem defective,
    even ugly, but from all these uglinesses, these defects,
    these irregularities arranged by the hand of the Graces, came
    a nameless harmony of her person, a delightful <i>ensemble</i>, the
    movement and airy whirl of which enchanted both eyes and
    soul. In moral qualities it was the same.</p>
<p>She played a part in &ldquo;Athalie;&rdquo; why should I not tell
    what she thought of that play, capricious child that she was?
    Apropos of its representation at Saint-Cyr, Mme. de Maintenon
    writes: &ldquo;Here is &lsquo;Athalie&rsquo; again breaking down. Ill-luck
    pursues all that I protect and care for. Mme. la
    Duchesse de Bourgogne tells me it can never succeed, that
    the piece is cold, that Racine regretted it, that I am the only
    person who likes it, and a number of other things which
    enable me to perceive, through the knowledge I have of this
    Court, that her part displeases her. She wants to play
    Josabeth, which she cannot play as well as the Comtesse
    d&rsquo;Ayen.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> As soon as they gave her the rôle she liked, the
    point of view was changed in a moment; such were the
    coulisses of Saint-Cyr! &ldquo;She is delighted,&rdquo; continues Mme.
    de Maintenon, &ldquo;and now thinks &lsquo;Athalie&rsquo; marvellous. Let
    us play it, then, inasmuch as we have agreed to do so; but,
    in truth, it is not agreeable to mix in the pleasures of the
    great.&rdquo; The Duchesse de Bourgogne came of that race of <i>the great</i> which will soon be a race departed. She deserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> to remain in the vista as a true representative in her
    transitory life of its lightest and most seductive charm.</p>
<p>The letters of the duchess which have been published up
    to this time are mere notes, adding nothing to the idea that
    we form of her mind. La Fare, in his memoirs written
    about the year 1699, has very well remarked that after the
    death of Madame, Henrietta of England (grandmother of
    Marie-Adélaïde) in 1670, the taste for things of intellect was
    greatly lowered in that brilliant Court of Louis XIV. &ldquo;It
    is certain,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that in losing that princess the Court
    lost the only person of her rank who was capable of liking
    and distinguishing real merit; since her death, nothing is
    seen but gambling, confusion, and impoliteness.&rdquo; Towards
    the close of the reign of Louis XIV. a taste for matters of
    mind and even for the refinements of wit reappeared no doubt
    and found favour in the little circles of Saint-Maur and
    Sceaux, but the body of the Court during that period was a
    victim to <i>bassette</i>, <i>lansquenet</i>, and other excesses, in which
    wine bore its fair share. The Duchesse de Berry, daughter
    of the future regent, was not the only young woman to
    whom it happened to be drunk. The Duchesse de Bourgogne
    herself, entering such society, found it difficult sometimes not
    to fall into the vices of the day, into those nets of which <i>lansquenet</i> was the best known and the most ruinous. More
    than once the king or Mme. de Maintenon paid her debts.
    But she asked for pardon with such good grace and submission
    by letter, and by word of mouth with such pretty
    and coaxing ways that she was sure to obtain it.</p>
<p>Those who judged her with the most severity are all
    agreed that she corrected herself with age, and that her
    will, her rare spirit, her sense of the rank she was about to
    hold, triumphed in the end over her first impetuosity and
    petulance. &ldquo;Three years before her death,&rdquo; writes Madame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> mother of the regent, honest and terrible woman who says
    all things bluntly, &ldquo;the dauphine had entirely changed, to
    her great advantage; she no longer made escapades or drank
    too much. Instead of behaving like an intractable being,
    she became sensible and polite, behaved according to her
    rank, and no longer allowed her young ladies to be familiar
    with her, and put their fingers in her dish.&rdquo; Uncomfortable
    praises, perhaps, with which we could dispense. But at this
    distance of time we can hear all without scruple, and, while
    doing homage to a person who had the gift of charm, we may
    dare to look on manners and customs as they were.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> We
    must resolve, whatever it costs us, to leave the chamber of
    Mme. de Maintenon and the twilight of its sanctuary. The
    Duchesse de Bourgogne has been pictured to us in the garb
    of Saint-Cyr; it is not in that habit that she is, to my thinking,
    most natural or truest.</p>
<p>A delicate question presents itself,&mdash;more delicate than
    that of <i>lansquenet</i>: did the Duchesse de Bourgogne have
    weaknesses of the heart? Adored by her young husband,
    and knowing how to take in hand his interests under all
    attacks, it does not seem that she had for his person a very
    warm or tender liking. Hence one does not see what there
    was to guarantee her from some other penchant. Saint-Simon,
    who is in no way malevolent to the Duchesse de
    Bourgogne, relates with great detail and as if receiving the
    confidences of well-informed persons, the slight weaknesses
    of the princess for M. de Nangis, M. de Maulévrier, and the
    Abbé de Polignac. &ldquo;At Marly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the dauphine
    would run about the gardens with other young people till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> three and four o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The king never knew
    of these nocturnal expeditions.&rdquo; Nevertheless, I do not
    desire to do otherwise than agree with Mme. de Caylus,
    who, while admitting the liking of the princess for M. de
    Nangis, makes haste to add: &ldquo;The only thing I doubt is
    whether the affair ever went so far as people thought; I am
    convinced that the whole intrigue took place in looks, and,
    at most, in a few letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of all her levity and childish frivolity the
    Duchesse de Bourgogne had serious good qualities, which
    increased as the years went on. She said very sweetly one
    day to Mme. de Maintenon: &ldquo;Aunt, I am under infinite
    obligations to you; you have had the patience to wait for
    my reason.&rdquo; She would no doubt have proved capable of
    State business and politics. The manner in which she
    knew how to defend the prince, her husband, against the
    cabal of the Duc de Vendôme, the striking revenge she
    took upon the latter at Marly, and the back-handed stroke
    by which she ousted him, show us plainly what she could
    do that was able and persistent when a matter came close
    to her heart. The few letters which she wrote to the Duc
    de Noailles, in which she says she knows nothing of politics,
    go to prove, on the contrary, that, if she could have talked
    about them instead of writing, she would have liked very
    well to take part in them. There is a more serious matter,
    which I see no reason for disguising. According to Duclos
    [author of &ldquo;The Secret Memoirs of the reign of Louis XIV.,&rdquo;
    etc.], this fascinating child, so dear to the king, did, nevertheless,
    betray France by informing her father, the Duc
    de Savoie, then become our enemy, of military plans which
    she was able to discover when, with playful familiarity and
    the liberty of entering the king&rsquo;s cabinet at all hours, she
    had the opportunity to read and learn those plans at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> source. The king, adds the historian, found the proofs of
    this treachery, after the death of the princess, in her desk.
    &ldquo;The little rogue,&rdquo; he is reported to have said to Mme. de
    Maintenon, &ldquo;deceived us after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of all, we find ourselves regretting that this
    princess, taken from us at the age of twenty-six, whose
    natural fairy-like presence bewitched all hearts, did not
    live to reign beside the virtuous pupil of Fénelon. The
    reign of their son, that Louis XV. who was only a pretty
    child at their deaths and became the most contemptible of
    kings, would at least have been postponed. But what good
    is there in re-making history and in setting up a mere idea
    of what <i>might have been</i>?</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>[Sainte-Beuve does not show his usual justice and careful
    discrimination in his foregoing semi-acceptance of Duclos&rsquo;
    tale of &ldquo;perfidy.&rdquo; The whole story of Marie-Adélaïde&rsquo;s
    position at the French Court should have been more clearly
    sifted. The two daughters of Vittorio Amadeo, Duke of
    Savoie, were, in a sense, hostages given by him to Louis
    XIV. in 1696 and 1701 as an earnest of faithful alliance.
    Circumstances, however, forced the duke in 1703 (during the
    war of the Spanish Succession) into the coalition against
    France.</p>
<p>From the tenth century the princes of the ancient house
    of Savoie had been, for various reasons geographical and
    political, the upholders of Italian unity, or, as one might
    better say, of Italian existence. France had felt this under
    all her attempts to master Italy, until finally her wisest statesmen,
    Henri IV., Richelieu, and Mazarin, saw that their true
    policy was to use Piedmont against the extension of the
    two branches of the House of Austria. The whole history
    of the Princes of Savoie is a romance, hitherto neglected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> which ought to be traced out and written by a sympathetic
    hand.</p>
<p>The alliance of France and Piedmont, so useful to the
    former by enabling her to maintain her conquests on the
    northern frontier, was converted by Louis XIV. into a
    species of vassalage, to which the indolent nature of Carlo
    Emmanuele submitted. The latter died in 1675, leaving
    one son, Vittorio Amadeo, aged nine, under the regency of
    his mother, Jeanne de Nemours, an ambitious and powerful
    woman. It is impossible to give here even a brief sketch
    of the House of Savoie, an heroic history, which should
    be rescued from the archives of Turin and elsewhere&mdash;in
    it will be found, we may add parenthetically, the story
    of the Waldenses and the secret of the Iron Mask.</p>
<p>Vittorio Amadeo married Anne, daughter of Monsieur,
    Louis XIV.&rsquo;s brother, by his first wife, Henrietta, daughter
    of Charles I., King of England. The grandmother to
    whom the following letters are chiefly addressed was the
    father&rsquo;s mother, Jeanne de Nemours.</p>
<p>These letters, which seem to us very short, were laborious
    undertakings to the princess, who was never able to write
    easily. The first, in a childish round text hand, filling a
    sheet of paper twenty-three centimetres long by sixteen
    centimetres wide, is better written than those of her after
    life. The grammar and the spelling improved somewhat
    in later years, though never keeping pace with the improvement
    in the diction. They are signed with a sort of hieroglyphic,
    seldom with her name, and tied by a silken thread,
    the seal being a lozenge with the arms of Savoie, or sometimes
    the impression of a little dog.</p>
<p>Returning to the charge of Duclos (an historian of gossip
    rather than of history), it seems enough to say: (1) that his
    story has never been supported in any way; (2) that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> tone of the princess&rsquo;s letters refutes it; (3) that what we
    know from Madame about the opening of letters makes
    it certain that the little duchess, surrounded as she was,
    could not have sent documents and plans undetected;
    (4) that Madame, that lynx for evil tales, and who did not
    like the dauphine, though she did her justice, makes no
    allusion to this story; and (5) that Saint-Simon, in a position
    to know everything, states the contrary.</p>
<p>The little princess arrived in France, and was met by
    the king at Montargis, November 4, 1696. The following
    is her first letter to her grandmother, Jeanne de Nemours,
    dowager Duchess of Savoie. This letter and one written
    two years later are here given in the French as amusing
    specimens of her spelling and punctuation.]</p>

<p>I think with you, my dear mother, that news from Spain
    comes slowly. I would like to know all that She does from
    morning till night, to satisfy the interest that I feel. I am,
    however, more easy now that I feel the true affection that
    exists between the King of Spain and Her. I hope, my dear
    mother, that we shall have in that direction sources of joy
    only.</p>

<p>I have no news from you this week, my dear mother, for
    which I am sorry: but I think the ice and snow are the
    reason. The wretched weather prevents our going to Marly,
    for it is not fit weather for the country. I fear this winter
    will give us no amusement that I can write about; on
    account of the mourning there may be no balls, theatres, or
    any pleasures. I do not regret it much, for the carnival
    is very short this year, and consequently more easy to do
    without.</p>

<p>I send you the plan which M. Mansart has returned to me.
    It seems to me very pretty, if the works are well executed.
    He begs me to ask if you would like him to send you a man
    to execute them. You have only to tell me what you wish.
    I will gladly take charge of it, my dear mother, desiring nothing
    so much as to please you in all things.</p>
<p>The King of Spain&rsquo;s journey to Italy is decided on. This
    gives me great pleasure, and I see at the same time that they
    are still greatly satisfied with my sister. I will tell you
    more by the next courier.</p>
<p>I am now going to see the Queen of England, and thence
    to Marly, where we shall dance. On this trip we played a
    comedy [this was the time when they played &ldquo;Athalie&rdquo;];
    the king was much pleased with it, and so was Monseigneur.
    Forgive me, my dear mother, if I write badly; it is because
    I am so hurried. You know well that I love best to write

<p>Thank God, I am rid of inflammation, my dear mother,
    after having my cheek swelled for a week, with fever at
    night. The great cold prevented them from giving me
    remedies, of which I was very glad; they wanted at all
    risks to bleed me, assuring me that the inflammation would
    continue if it were not done. However, I am rid of the swelling
    without it, and, provided it does not return, I am content.</p>
<p>I am very sorry, my dear mother, that you do not receive
    my letters regularly; yours do not play me the same trick.
    The prospect of peace continues wonderfully good, and it
    makes me hope that we shall soon have it. I own to you,
    my dear mother, that I await it with great impatience, for I
    think we shall all have reason then to be satisfied. It will be
    a great consolation to me to see no more of this vile war
    which has lasted for so long a time.</p>
<p>Adieu, my dear mother; love me always, and be assured
    of the tender feelings that I have for you.</p>

<p>We have been much afflicted, my dear grandmother [by
    the death of Monsieur, her maternal grandfather] and I have
    felt for my own sake much more than I expected. I loved
    Monsieur very much and I think he loved me. His death
    was unexpected, at least by us, and all the circumstances
    were painful. I am convinced, my dear grandmother, that
    you have felt it also, and I count on your affection under all
    events. Never doubt that which I have for you.</p>

    more. The king does not take it; M. Fagon orders him sage

    do the same with you; no one in the world feels more interest
    in you than I, my dear grandmother.</p>

<p>I cannot, my dear grandmother, be longer without comforting

    [death of her son]. I am convinced that you have felt it, for
    I know the affection you have for me. If we did not take all
    the sorrows of this life from God, I do not know what would
    become of us. I think He wants to draw me to Him, by overwhelming
    me with every sort of grief. My health suffers
    greatly, but that is the least of my troubles.</p>
<p>I have received one of your letters, my dear grandmother,
    which gave me great pleasure; the assurances of your affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> bring me consolation. I have great need of it in my

<p>I can be no longer, my dear grandmother, without sharing
    all our troubles with you. Imagine my anxiety as to what
    is happening with you, loving you as I do very tenderly and
    having all possible affection for my father, my mother, and
    my brothers. I cannot think of them in so unhappy a position
    without tears in my eyes, for assuredly, my dear grandmother,
    I feel for all that concerns you, and I see by all that
    is in me to what point my love for my family goes.</p>
<p>My health is not so much injured as it might be; I am
    pretty well, but in a state of sadness which no amusement
    can lessen, and which will never leave me, my dear grandmother,
    for it serves to comfort me in my present state.</p>
<p>Do not deprive me, I conjure you, of your letters. They
    give me much pleasure; I need them in the state I am in.

<p>I have not written, my dear grandmother, not knowing
    if you are still with my mother, being unable to obtain
    the slightest information. You know my heart; imagine
    therefore the state I am in. I feel for yours; I cannot be
    reconciled to your trials; I see them increasing with extreme
    sorrow; there is not a day when I do not feel them keenly,
    and weep in thinking of what my dear family&mdash;whom I
    would give my life to comfort&mdash;is suffering.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>I am glad, my dear grandmother, that the fatigues of so
    sad and painful a journey [the removal of the royal family
    from Turin before the siege] has not injured your health.
    I pity my mother, who, for additional sorrow, is anxious
    about the illness of her children and yet is obliged to travel
    with them in such excessive heat and over such dreadful
    roads.</p>
<p>I have no other comfort, my dear grandmother, than in
    receiving your letters and the assurance of your affection.
    We all need great courage to sustain such violent griefs as
    those we have had of late. God is trying me by ways in
    which I feel it most; I must resign myself to His will, and
    pray that He will soon withdraw us from the state in which
    we are. As for me, I feel I cannot bear it longer if He does
    not give me strength.</p>

<p>I am delighted, my dear grandmother, that you exhort
    me to give you frequent news of my son [the second Duc
    de Bretagne, born January 7, 1707]; I assure you I do not
    need to be urged to do so. He is very well, thank God.
    I found him much grown and changed for the better on my
    return to Marly. He is not handsome, up to this time,
    but very lively, and much healthier than he was when he
    came into the world. He is only two months old, and I
    should not be surprised if, a few months hence, he became
    pretty. I don&rsquo;t know whether it is that I am beginning
    to blind myself about him and therefore hope it. But I
    believe that I shall never be blind about my children, and
    that the love I have for them will make me see their
    defects and so try in good season to correct them.</p>
<p>I go very seldom to see my son, in order not to grow too
    attached to him; also to note the changes in him. He
    is not old enough to play with as yet, and as long as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> know he is in good health, I am satisfied; that is all I need

    precious to me than all. I beg you, my dear aunt, not to
    speak of this in case I keep the resolution I have made.
    If I break it only once, I should be glad that the king
    would forbid me to play, and I would bear whatever impression
    it might make against me in his mind. I shall
    never console myself for being the cause of your troubles,
    and I will not forget that cursèd <i>lansquenet</i>. All that I
    desire in the world is to be a princess esteemed for my

<p>I am afraid, my dear grandmother, that if you have the
    same weather that we do you will suffer from inflammation.
    There is not a day that it does not rain and that causes
    great humidity. The milk I am taking does me good,
    but if I come in late I have toothache during the night.
    But my health is coming back to its usual state. You

<p>The milk I have taken did not do me as much good as
    I hoped during the time I took it; but since I left it off I
    think I am the better for it. [It was probably asses&rsquo; milk, a
    great remedy in those days.] I have taken it with all possible
    regularity; for when I do take remedies I do it
    thoroughly. My face is coming to itself, and I am beginning

<p>[It was during this summer that the cabal of Vendôme, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> as Saint-Simon calls it, the cabal of Meudon, made its great
    attempt to ruin the Duc de Bourgogne during the campaign
    in Flanders, and that his wife proved her brave spirit in defending
    him. The princess&rsquo;s own letters say nothing of
    all this; but a letter exists from the Duc de Bourgogne
    to Mme. de Maintenon, who seems to have written to
    him to counteract some attack upon his wife, which is as
    follows:&mdash;]</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Camp of Lowendeghem</span>, August 27, 1708.<br />
</p>
<p>It is not very difficult to justify Madame la Duchesse de
    Bourgogne to me as to matters on which I do not place entire
    faith, and I am only too much inclined to be favourable
    to her in everything. But the affection of which she has
    now given me such signal marks made me apprehend that
    she might have gone a little too far in certain speeches. I
    have already told her several times that I am satisfied with
    what she has replied to me as to this, and my present fear
    is that I may have pained her a little by what I wrote to
    her. I beg you to tell her so once more, madame, and to
    make her see how charmed I am with her affection and confidence.
    I flatter myself that I deserve them, and I shall
    endeavour more and more to merit her esteem.</p>
<p>To-day is not the first time that I have known of persons
    at Court who do not like her, and who see with annoyance
    the affection that the king shows for her. I believe I am
    not ignorant of their names. It will be for you, madame,
    when I see you, to enlighten me more particularly, that
    proper precautions may be taken to save Madame la Duchesse
    de Bourgogne from falling into certain very dangerous
    traps, which I have often seen you dread. As for mischief-making,
    it would be most unjust to accuse her of that; she
    sovereignly despises it, and her spirit is far indeed from
    being what is called the woman&rsquo;s spirit. She has assuredly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> a solid mind, much good sense, an excellent and very noble
    heart&mdash;but you know her better than I, and this portrait is
    useless. Perhaps the pleasure that I have in speaking of
    her prevents me from perceiving that I do it too often and
    at too great length.</p>

<p>The assurances, my dear father, that my mother gives me
    of your continued affection for me have caused me too much
    pleasure not to make me tell you myself of my gratitude,
    and how sensible I am of your remembrance. Nothing can
    ever diminish my respect and tenderness for you. Blood,
    my dear father, makes itself warmly felt under all circumstances,
    and in spite of my destiny&mdash;unfortunate because it
    puts me in a party opposed to yours&mdash;your interests are so
    strongly imprinted in my heart that nothing can make me
    wish the contrary. But this very tenderness only increases
    my grief when I think that we are among the number of
    your enemies. I own that affection may feel somewhat
    wounded by seeing you arrayed against both your daughters.
    But as for me, I will never be against you, and I can only
    regard you as the father whom I love as my own life. But
    that is not saying enough; I would willingly sacrifice my
    life for you; your interests are the sole object of my
    present desires.</p>
<p>Permit me, therefore, my dear father, to forestall by a day
    the coming year and to wish that it may lead us to the end
    of my sorrow and reunite us in a manner that shall crown
    us with joy. I venture to tell you that it depends on you
    alone to make me the happiest person in the world.</p>

    you will pardon me the liberty I take. I cannot prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> myself from assuring you at least once a year of my tenderness
    and respect, asking you at the same time for the continuation

<p>It appears that the excessive cold prevails everywhere.
    They say it is two hundred years since such a severe winter
    has been known here. It is thought impossible to keep Lent
    because all vegetables are frozen, and the archbishop will be
    obliged to allow three meat days a week. As for me, I am
    not interested, for my health does not allow me to fast; fish
    makes me ill.</p>
<p>I have a strong desire to drive out on a sledge; for I never
    did so; a very pleasant idea of it is in my mind from having
    seen my mother do it. But I own I have not enough courage
    on account of the bitter cold. I shall not have much
    trouble in giving you an account of the amusements of
    this carnival. It has been very dull up to this time, and I
    think it will end in the same way. There can be no balls,
    for there is no one to dance. Several ladies are pregnant,
    and those who are lately married come from convents and
    do not know how to dance. There are but nine ladies
    who can do so, and half of those are little girls. I should
    be the old woman of a ball [æt. 23], which takes away all
    my desire for one. I do not know what folly possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> the women now, but at thirty years of age they think they
    are past dancing; if the fashion lasts, I ought to make the

    give you another grandson, and I do not doubt it, for I am
    as I was with the two others.</p>
<p>I have been in the greatest anxiety the last week; but
    never was a lost battle so advantageous and glorious
    [Malplaquet]. That is to me a great consolation. You will
    hear, my dear grandmother, from my sister the anxiety she,
    too, has been in about the King of Spain, who started hurriedly
    to put himself at the head of his army because he was
    not satisfied with the man&#339;uvring of the man who commanded
    it.</p>

    about which we are forced to keep silence now? This war
    has lasted so long! I believe that all of those who are making
    it desire its end; and yet in spite of that it continues.
    The more you could look into the bottom of my heart, the
    better you would know, my dear grandmother, that it is
    what it should be, and full of feeling&mdash;which does not contribute
    to my tranquillity. But I have no regret for what I
    suffer, for I know that blood and duty ordain it for me.</p>
<p>I have spent my day in the church, which is no small
    matter in my present condition. Now that I have passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> the eighth month I am very languishing. The changes of

<p>There is no talk of anything here, my dear grandmother,
    but the marriage of the Duc de Berry. Though it will take
    place without any ceremony (for the times do not allow
    amusements or great expenses), all the ladies are none the
    less busy with their finery. This does not render conversation
    very lively, nor does it give much matter for a letter,
    for really nothing is talked of but head-dresses, costumes,
    petticoats, and milliners, and though I am a woman, I never
    take much pleasure in such discussions. I have a great
    desire for the wedding to take place and end all discussions
    about it. They are waiting for the dispensation from Rome.
    I hope in ten or twelve days to send you a brief account of
    the event.</p>
<p>Every one tells me that my father will begin the campaign
    on the first of next month. Judge, therefore, my dear

<p>M. le Duc de Berry was married yesterday. It was all as
    magnificent as the season and the times would allow. There
    was no fête; and that is all I can tell you to-day, being
    completely wearied out.</p>

<p>I am always afraid, my dear grandmother, to bore you by
    talking of my children, but since you order me to give you
    news of them, I obey you with pleasure. I shall begin by
    telling you that the elder is getting sense enough to know
    he has a grandmother, and that he loves you. He grows
    immensely and, consequently, is very thin; he is well-made,
    but rather ugly. The little one is not the same; he is a fat
    dumpling and very handsome; he will soon have four teeth,
    and is in fine health. As soon as he is one year old I will
    send you his portrait; I dare not have it painted any earlier,
    for they say it brings ill-luck. I do not believe that; but
    the case of my eldest makes me prefer to risk nothing.</p>

<p class="sig"> <span class="smcap">Marly</span>, February 16, 1711.<br />
</p>
<p>I am so charmed, my dear father, with the letter you
    have written me that I cannot prevent myself from telling
    you how sensitive I am to the assurances you give me of
    your affection. I assure you that I deserve it through the
    tenderness that I shall feel for you throughout my life.
    Would to God, my dear father, that this year might be to me
    as happy as you have been kind enough to wish it.</p>
<p>There is but one thing lacking to my happiness, but it is
    a thing that is very near my heart. I shall never accustom
    myself to be in other interests than yours, and I own to you
    that my duty in vain compels me to be so; nature <i>will</i> have
    the upper hand, and I cannot keep myself from continually
    praying for you. But, indeed, my dear father, is it not high
    time to end our sorrows? The advantages we have won
    in Spain made me hope that peace would follow. But the
    only peace that I can have can come through you alone.</p>
<p>I would not end my letter so soon, for I have many things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> to say to you, if I did not fear to say too much on a topic
    which is not suitable for me in any way. Forgive it, my
    dear father, in favour of a daughter whose tenderness alone
    inclines her to speak, and who longs to see you both content
    and glorious.</p>
<p>[No letters exist concerning the most important event in
    the Duchesse de Bourgogne&rsquo;s life, the death of Monseigneur,
    which made her dauphine, April 10, 1711. From that moment
    she felt more deeply the importance of fitting herself
    for the great post she expected soon to fill.]</p>

<p class="center"><i>To her mother.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> <span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, May 3, 1711.<br />
</p>
<p>I have had no letters from you by this courier, my very
    dear mother; I hope, however, they may reach me within a
    few days.</p>
<p>We have had very good news from Barcelona, and from
    all sides pleasant things are reaching us. All that is taking
    place in Italy causes me to make many reflections and gives
    me many hopes. I confess the truth, my very dear mother,
    it would be the greatest happiness I could have in this life
    if I could see my father brought back to reason. I cannot
    comprehend how it is that he does not make terms, above
    all in the unfortunate position in which he now finds himself,
    and without any hope whatever of succour. Will he
    let them take Turin again? The rumour is afloat here that
    it will not be long before that siege is laid. Judge, therefore,
    my dear mother, of the state I must be in,&mdash;I, so
    sensitive to all that concerns you. I am in despair at the
    position to which my father is reduced by his own fault.
    Is it possible that he really thinks we will not give him
    good terms? I assure you that all the king wants is to see
    his kingdom tranquil, and that of his grandson, the King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> Spain, secure. It seems to me that my father ought to desire
    the same thing for himself, and when I consider that he
    is master of making it so, I am astonished that he does not
    do it.</p>
<p>I fear, my very dear mother, that you will think me too daring
    in what I say, but I cannot restrain myself under the view
    I take of my father&rsquo;s position. I feel that he is my father,
    and a father whom I deeply love. Therefore, my very dear
    mother, forgive me if I write too freely. It is the desire I
    have that we should all escape these difficult moments that
    makes me write as I do. I send you a letter from my sister,
    who is just as vexed as I am at what is now going on.</p>
<p class="sig">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Versailles</span>, December 13, 1711.<br />
</p>
<p>It is sad, my dear mother, that my brother and I have
    the same sympathy in toothache. I hope he has not had
    anything like that which I had last night; it made me suffer
    horribly, not being rid of it one moment. For more than
    two months it has seized me from time to time. I have
    ceased taking care of it, for keeping my room does me no
    good, and during the time I am not in it I am thinking and
    always hoping the pain may not return. I merely avoid the
    wind in my ears, and eating anything which may hurt me.
    I think the dreadful weather contributes to these face-aches.</p>
<p>As for me, my dear mother, I cannot be as reserved as you
    in speaking about the peace; I absolutely must tell you
    what I think of it. We have to-day another courier from
    England which confirms the hopes I feel. The conferences
    will be held at Utrecht, and will begin on the twelfth of next
    month. [The peace she longed for was not signed at Utrecht
    until a year after her death.] They would not make such
    advances if they were not veritably resolved to conclude a
    peace so desired by all and so necessary to Europe. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> only the emperor who still will not listen to it; but when
    he finds himself alone he will surely come into it. They say
    it is his usual way to make difficulties, and that the last
    time he made as many as he makes now. I hope that soon
    you will not be so reserved with me, and that we shall all
    have every reason to rejoice together.</p>
<p>I look forward to the great pleasure of once more seeing
    the Piedmontese in this country, and of being able to talk to
    them of you, of all my dear family, and of the country, the
    mere recollection of which is so pleasant to me.</p>
<p>Poor Mme. du Lude is again attacked with gout in the
    breast and feet; she suffers much. I am very much afraid
    that in the end it will play her some bad trick. Madame is
    taking remedies; she was bled two days ago and has taken
    medicine to-day. It was not before she wanted it, for she
    drops asleep everywhere, which gives much anxiety to all
    those who take an interest in her. She must have felt the
    need of remedies to have brought herself to take them.
    Adieu, my dear mother, I embrace you with all my heart.</p>

</p>
<p>It is in order not to miss a week in assuring you myself
    of my tenderness that I write to-day. For the last seven
    days I have been, my dear mother, in a state of great
    exhaustion which has prevented me from dressing; for the
    inflammation that I had in my teeth has spread now over
    my whole body. I can scarcely move; and my head feels
    a horrible weight.</p>
<p>I wanted to forestall the first day of the year by offering
    to all my family the wishes I desire for them; not being
    able to do so, I content myself, my dear mother, by embracing
    you with all my heart.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>
<h3>MME. DE MAINTENON AND SAINT-CYR.</h3>
<h3 class="mf">PRECEDED BY REMARKS OF</h3>
<h3>C.-A. SAINTE-BEUVE.</h3>
<p>I have just read a pleasing, sweet, simple, and even touching
    narrative, which rests and elevates the mind,&mdash;a narrative
    which all should read as I have done. It concerns, once
    more, Mme. de Maintenon; but Mme. de Maintenon taken
    this time on her practical side, which is least open to discussion,
    namely, her work and foundation of Saint-Cyr. M. le duc
    de Noailles had already given a brief but interesting account
    of it in his prelude to the &ldquo;History of Madame de Maintenon,&rdquo;
    but M. Théophile Lavallée has now published a complete
    and connected &ldquo;History of Saint-Cyr,&rdquo; which may be
    called definitive.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;"> <img src="images/257.jpg" width="525" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"> <i>Mme. de Maintenon</i></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In studying the history of Mme. de Maintenon there has
    happened to M. Lavallée what will happen to all sound but
    prejudiced minds (and I sometimes meet with such) who
    will approach this distinguished personage and take pains to
    know her in her habit of life. I will not say that he is converted
    to her; that would be an ill-rendering of a simply
    equitable impression received by an upright mind; but he
    has brought justice to bear on that mass of fantastic and
    odiously vague imputations which have long been in circulation
    as to the assumed historical rôle of this celebrated
    woman. He sees her as she was, wholly concerned for the
    salvation of the king, for his reform, his decent amusement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> for the interior life of the royal family, for the relief of the
    people, and doing all this, it is true, with more rectitude than
    enthusiasm, more precision than grandeur.</p>
<p>On the threshold of Saint-Cyr M. Lavallée has placed a
    portrait of its illustrious founder in which lives again that
    grace of hers, so real, so sober, so indefinable, which, liable
    as it is to disappear in the distance, should not be overlooked
    when at times her image seems to us too hard and cold. He
    borrows this portrait from a Dame de Saint-Cyr whose pen,
    in its vivacity and colour, is worthy of a Sévigné: &ldquo;She had,
    at fifty years of age, a most agreeable tone of voice, an affectionate
    air, an open, smiling forehead, natural gesture with
    her beautiful hands, eyes of fire, and motions of an easy
    figure so cordial, so harmonious, that she put into the shade
    the greatest beauties of the Court.... At a first glance she
    seemed imposing, as if veiled in severity; the smile and the
    voice dispersed the cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saint-Cyr, in its completed idea, was not only a girls&rsquo;
    school, then a convent for young ladies of rank, a good
    work and recreation for Mme. de Maintenon; it was something
    more loftily conceived, a foundation worthy in all
    respects of Louis XIV. and his epoch. Under Louis XIV.,
    and especially during the second half of his reign, France,
    even in times of peace, was compelled to maintain its
    imposing military attitude and a powerful army of 150,000
    men under arms. Louvois introduced a system of modern
    organization into that great body; though the essentially
    modern base, the regular and equal contribution of all to
    military service, was still lacking. The nobility, which was,
    and continued to be, the soul of war, found itself for the first
    time subjected to strict rules and obligations which offended
    its spirit and greatly aggravated its burdens. Consequently,
    royalty contracted towards it fresh duties. Louis XIV. saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> this, and had the heart to meet his obligation,&mdash;first, by
    founding the Hôtel des Invalides, a part of which was
    reserved for old or wounded officers; secondly, by forming
    companies of Cadets, exercised at the frontier forts, in which
    four thousand sons of nobles were brought up; and thirdly
    (as soon as Mme. de Maintenon suggested to him the idea),
    by the foundation of the royal house of Saint-Cyr, intended
    for the education of two hundred and fifty noble but impoverished
    young ladies. The establishment in the succeeding
    century of the École Militaire, was the necessary complement
    of these monarchical foundations; it added all that was insufficient
    in the companies of Cadets.</p>
<p>The first thought of Saint-Cyr in Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s
    mind did not rise to this height. Mme. de Maintenon was
    sincerely religious. She was no sooner drawn from indigence
    by the bounty of the king than she said in her own mind
    that she ought to shed something of that bounty on others as
    poor as she herself had once been. This idea of succouring
    poor young ladies and preserving them from dangers through
    which she herself had passed was a very old and very natural
    thing in her; she regarded it as a debt and an indemnity
    before God for her great fortune. Her first step was to
    gather a number of young ladies, for whose education she
    paid, at Montmorency, then at Rueil; at which latter place
    she gave more development to her good intention. She had
    always had a great taste for bringing up children, for teaching
    them, reproving and reprimanding them; it was one of
    her particular and prominent talents. From Rueil the Institution
    was transferred to Noisy, where it continued to increase,
    Mme. de Maintenon devoting to it every instant she could
    steal from the Court. She soon began to congratulate herself
    on its success. &ldquo;Fancy my pleasure,&rdquo; she writes to her
    brother, &ldquo;when I return along the avenue, followed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> hundred and eighty-four young ladies who are here at the
    present time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon was made for this sort of internal
    domestic government. She had the gift and the art of it;
    she enjoyed the full pleasure of it. That is no reason why
    we should estimate her merit to be less. Because she
    sought repose in action, delights in authority and familiarity,
    and because her self-love (from which we never part) found
    its satisfaction there, we should not the less admire her. An
    ancient poet, Simonides of Amorgos, in a satire against
    women, compares them for their dominant defects, when
    they are bad, to various species of animals (those Ancients
    were not gallant), but when he comes to a wise, useful,
    frugal, industrious, diligent, and fruitful woman he compares
    her to the bee. Mme. de Maintenon, in the bosom of this
    establishment of which she was the soul and the mother,
    ruling the hive in every sense, may be likened to the indefatigable
    bee. Such she had been all her life in the houses
    where she lived on a footing of friendship; putting them
    into order, cleanliness, decency, spreading a spirit of work
    about her, and at the same time doing honour also to the
    spirit of society and courtesy. What must it therefore have
    been in her own domain, her own foundation, in the hive of
    her predilection, with all her joy and all her pride as queen-bee
    and mother, having at last succeeded in producing the
    perfect ideal that was in her?</p>
<p>That ideal was patriotic and Christian both. One day, in
    an interview, the record of which was written down by her
    pious pupils, after telling them how little premeditated and
    foreseen was her great fortune at Court, she said with a
    transport and fire we should scarcely expect of her, but
    which was in her whenever she dwelt on a cherished topic:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is how it was with Saint-Cyr, which became insensibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> what you see it to-day. I have often told you that I
    do not like new establishments; it is far better to support
    old ones. And yet, almost without thinking of it, I have
    made a new one. Every one believes that I, my head on my
    pillow, have planned this fine institution; but it is not so.
    God has brought about Saint-Cyr by degrees. If I had made
    a plan, I should have thought of the worries of execution,
    the difficulties, the details. I should have feared them; I
    should have said: &lsquo;All this is far beyond me;&rsquo; courage would
    have failed me. Much compassion for indigent nobility, because
    I have been orphaned and poor myself, and knowledge
    of such a life, made me desire to assist it in my lifetime.
    But, while planning to do the good I could, I never dreamed
    of doing it after my death. That was a second thought, born
    of the first. May this establishment last as long as France
    itself, and France as long as the world! Nothing is dearer
    to me than my children of Saint-Cyr; I love their very dust.
    I offer myself, and all my attendants to serve them; I have
    no reluctance to be their servant if my service will teach
    them to do without that of others. It is to this I tend; this
    is my passion, this is my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the year of her marriage (1684) that she applied
    herself, as an inward thank-offering towards Heaven, to perfect
    the attempt at Noisy, and to give it that first royal
    character which it assumed wholly after its removal to
    Saint-Cyr. She represented to the king, after a visit he had
    made to Noisy which had pleased him much, that &ldquo;the
    greater part of the noble families of the kingdom were reduced
    to a pitiable state, owing to the costs their heads had
    been forced to incur in his service; that their children
    required support to prevent them from falling into utter
    degradation; that it would be a work worthy of his piety
    and greatness to make a settled establishment as a refuge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> for poor young girls of rank throughout the kingdom, where
    they could be brought-up piously to the duties of their condition.&rdquo;
    Père de La Chaise approved the project; Louvois
    cried out at the expense; Louis XIV. himself seemed to
    hesitate. &ldquo;Never did Queen of France,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do anything
    like this.&rdquo; It was thus, and thus only, that Mme. de
    Maintenon allowed herself to manifest her secret but efficacious
    royalty.</p>
<p>The idea of the foundation of Saint-Cyr was accepted, and
    the king spoke of it to the council of August 15, 1684.
    Two years went by, during which the house was built [by
    Mansart at a cost of 1,200,000 francs], the endowments and
    revenues were settled, and the Constitution was prepared.
    Letters-patent were delivered in June, 1686, and the Community
    was transferred from Noisy to the new domicile
    between the 26th of July and the 1st of August. During
    the succeeding six years it felt its way and made tentative
    essays; these were most brilliant, and even glorious; never
    did Saint-Cyr make more noise in the world than during
    this period before it was firmly seated on its permanent and
    sure foundation.</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon had dreamed of an establishment like
    no other; where all should go by rule without being bound
    by vows; where absolutely nothing of the minutiæ and pettiness
    of convents should exist; maintaining, nevertheless, at
    the same time purity and ignorance of evil, while sharing,
    with prudence and Christian reserve, in the charms of society
    and polished intercourse. Louis XIV., who saw all things
    with a practical eye and in the interests of the State, approved
    of Saint-Cyr having nothing monastic about it, and
    would fain have kept it so. But precautions were needed in
    this first attempt of Mme. de Maintenon to mingle substantial
    qualities, reason, and charm, which she found it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> impossible to maintain; to do so all the mistresses and all
    the pupils needed a wisdom and strength equal to her own.
    To bring up young ladies in a &ldquo;Christian, reasonable, and
    noble manner&rdquo; was her object; but a danger soon appeared
    that <i>nobleness</i> would lead to contempt of humility, and
    reasonableness to a spirit of reasoning.</p>
<p>It was during these tentative years, while Saint-Cyr was
    trying its wings and working out its apprenticeship, that
    Mme. de Maintenon requested Racine to compose the sacred
    comedies that were there performed. If &ldquo;Esther,&rdquo; with the
    worldly consequences and the introduction of the élite of
    profane society that then ensued, proved a distraction and
    perhaps an imprudence and fault in Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s
    management of the first Saint-Cyr, we feel that we ought
    not to cavil, and no one in the world can really blame her.
    &ldquo;Esther&rdquo; has remained, in the eyes of all, the crown of that
    establishment. The details of the composition of that adorable
    play and its representation are too well known to need
    repetition; they form one of the most graceful and assuredly
    the most original episodes of our dramatic literature. Nevertheless,
    Mme. de La Fayette, like a sensible woman, and one
    a little jealous, perhaps, of Mme. de Maintenon, found it a
    pretext to say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Mme. de Maintenon, who is the foundress of Saint-Cyr,
        always busy with the purpose of amusing the king, is constantly
        introducing some novelty among the little girls
        brought up in that establishment, of which it may be said
        that it is worthy of the grandeur of the king and of the mind
        of her who invented and who conducts it. But sometimes
        the best-invented things degenerate considerably; and that
        establishment which, now that we have become devout, is the
        abode of virtue and piety, may some day, without any profound
        prophesying, be that of debauchery and impiety. For
        to believe that three hundred young girls can live there until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> they are twenty years old with a Court full of eager young men
        at their very doors, especially when the authority of the king
        will no longer restrain them,&mdash;to believe, I say, that young
        women and young men can be so near to each other without
        jumping the walls is scarcely reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It became necessary, after the success of &ldquo;Esther,&rdquo; and the
    instigation given to the Court, to make a step backward and
    return to the spirit of the foundation, fortifying it by more
    severe regulations. The danger of the neighbourhood of
    Saint-Cyr to Versailles was indeed great; it was of the
    utmost consequence that Mme. de La Fayette&rsquo;s prophecy
    should not be fulfilled, and that the young ladies of Saint-Cyr
    should in no wise resemble those of M. Alexandre
    Dumas. The lesson that Mme. de Maintenon drew from
    the representations of &ldquo;Esther,&rdquo; and the invasion of the profane
    was henceforth to say and resay ceaselessly to her
    teachers: &ldquo;Hide your pupils; do not let them be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the passage of Racine through Saint-Cyr, and that
    of Fénelon, there resulted (from the point of view of the
    foundation and its object) a number of unsuitable things in
    the midst of their graces. Fénelon developed a taste for
    refined and subtile piety suited only for choice souls;
    Racine, without intending it, created a taste for reading,
    poesy, and all such things, the perfume of which is sweet, but
    the fruit not always salutary. Mme. de Maintenon, however
    influenced she might herself be by these tastes, recognized
    with her natural good sense the necessity of finding a
    remedy, and of not allowing those young and tender spirits,
    some of whom were already taken with the new ideas, to go
    farther in that direction. Among the first pupils and mistresses
    of Saint-Cyr was a certain Mme. de La Maisonfort,
    a distinguished woman, with an inquiring spirit, fond of
    investigating, and made for quite another career than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> which she had chosen. She could not bring herself to renounce
    the gratifications of her mind and taste or the sensitiveness
    of her feelings. Mme. de Maintenon made war upon
    them in a number of very fine letters, which did not convince
    her. &ldquo;How will you bear,&rdquo; she writes to her, &ldquo;the crosses
    that God will send you in the course of your life if a
    Norman or a Picard accent hinders you, or a man disgusts
    you because he is not as sublime as Racine? The latter,
    poor man, would have edified you could you have seen his
    humility during his illness, and his repentance for his search
    after intellect. He did not ask at such a time for a fashionable
    confessor; he saw none but a worthy priest of his own
    parish.&rdquo; That example of the dying Racine did not work
    successfully. Mme. de La Maisonfort was one of those rare
    persons whom we see from time to time soaring to the
    summit of all the investigations of their epoch, supreme and
    refined judges of works of intellect, oracles and proselytes
    of the opinions in vogue. She could play charmingly at
    Jansenism with Racine and M. de Troisville, and distil
    Quietism with Fénelon, as in the eighteenth century she
    might have fallen in love with David Hume in company
    with the Comtesse de Boufflers, or in the nineteenth she
    would surely have shone in a <i>doctrinaire</i> salon discussing
    psychology and æstheticism, perhaps even going so far as
    the Fathers of the Church, not without adverting, as she
    passed, to socialism. Mme. de La Maisonfort, much as she
    was liked by Mme. de Maintenon, was, necessarily, dismissed
    from the Institute of Saint-Cyr.</p>
<p>Another mind, much better and much safer, that of Mme.
    de Glapion, was slightly affected by the new doctrines. &ldquo;I
    have perceived,&rdquo; Mme. de Maintenon writes to her, &ldquo;the
    disgust you feel for your confessors; you think them vulgar;
    you want more brilliancy and delicacy; you wish to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> heaven by none but flowery paths.&rdquo; Mme. de Glapion
    thought the Catechism rather grovelling and a little wanting
    in certain ways; it seemed to her ridiculous &ldquo;that the master
    should put questions worthy of a scholar, and that the
    scholar should make the answers of a master.&rdquo; She wished
    the question to be put by the child, who, after receiving the
    answer, should reason upon it and so be led from one investigation
    to another. Mme. de Glapion wished, as we see,
    to introduce the method of Descartes into theology. Mme.
    de Maintenon did not discuss the point; but she held up
    custom, experience, the impossibility of not stammering in
    such matters. &ldquo;All those ideas,&rdquo; she wrote to Mme. de
    Glapion, &ldquo;are the remains of vanity. You do not like things
    common to all the world; your own mind is lofty, and you
    wish everything to be as lofty. Vain desire! The most
    learned theology cannot tell you more about the Trinity
    than you find in the Catechism. What you think and feel
    beyond that is a matter to be sacrificed; your spirit must
    become as simple as your heart. Employ your mind, not in
    multiplying your disgusts, but in conquering them, in concealing
    them until they are conquered, and in making yourself
    like the pleasures of your condition.&rdquo; Mme. de Glapion
    succeeded in doing so. She was the consolation of Mme. de
    Maintenon and her truest inheritor; together with Madame
    du Pérou, she maintained at Saint-Cyr that spirit of precision
    and regularity combined with suavity and noble
    manners which distinguished the foundress, until long after
    the latter&rsquo;s death. It may be said, definitively, that the
    persons of the generation at Saint-Cyr who had known and
    enjoyed Racine and Fénelon, and who remembered all of
    which they were cured, could alone realize the perfection of
    the education, the grace, and the language of Saint-Cyr;
    after them the essential virtues and the rules were kept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> but the charm had flown, perhaps we may even say the
    life.</p>
<p>During these years of labour and tentative effort Mme.
    de Maintenon never ceased to visit, inspire, and correct
    Saint-Cyr; she went there once in every two days at least,
    remaining whole days whenever she could. She took part
    in the classes, in the exercises, in the smallest details of the
    establishment, thinking nothing beneath her. &ldquo;I have often
    seen her,&rdquo; says one of the modest historians quoted by M.
    Lavallée, &ldquo;arrive before six in the morning in order to be
    present at the rising of the young ladies, and follow them
    throughout their whole day in the capacity of first instructress,
    in order to judge properly of what should be done and
    regulated. She helped to comb and dress the little ones.
    Often she gave two or three consecutive months to one
    class, observing the order of the day, talking to the class in
    general and to each member in private; reproving one,
    encouraging another, giving to all the means of correcting
    themselves. She had much grace in speaking, as in all
    else that she did. Her talks were lively, simple, natural,
    intelligent, insinuating, persuasive. I should never finish
    if I tried to relate all the good she did to the classes in those
    happy days.&rdquo; Those &ldquo;happy days,&rdquo; that golden age, was
    the period of the start, the beginning, when all was not yet
    reduced to a code, when a certain liberty of inexperience
    was mingled with the early freshness of virtue.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, under the wise direction of the Bishop of
    Chartres, Mme. de Maintenon felt the necessity of giving to
    her enterprise less peculiarity than she had at first intended.
    It was decided that the &ldquo;Dames institutrices,&rdquo; while remaining
    true to the special object of their trust, should be
    regular nuns under solemn vows. Warned by the first
    irregularities and the fancies that she saw were dawning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> she busied herself in making a rampart for her girls of their
    Constitution and rules. She understood, like all great
    founders, that we can draw from human nature a particular
    and extraordinary strength in one direction only by suppressing,
    or at least repressing, in all others. This final
    reform, this transformation of Saint-Cyr from a secular house
    into a regular nunnery, was completed between the years
    1692 and 1694. The grave nature of Mme. de Maintenon
    is imprinted on every line of the little book addressed to
    the &ldquo;Dames&rdquo; and entitled &ldquo;The Spirit of the Institute of
    the Daughters of Saint-Louis.&rdquo; The first suggestion made
    to them is in terms as absolute as can well be imagined;
    nothing is ever to be changed or modified in their rule under
    any pretext whatsoever; solidity, stability, immovability is
    the vow and the command of Mme. de Maintenon&mdash;and the
    Institute remained faithful thereto to its last hour. The Institution
    was not founded, says the book, for prayer, but for
    action, for the <i>education of young ladies</i>; that is its true austerity;
    that is, as it were, the perpetual prayer, which needs
    only to be fed by other rapid and short prayers repeated
    often in the depths of the heart. &ldquo;A mixture of prayer
    and action,&rdquo; such was the spirit of the Institute. Mme.
    de Maintenon endeavours to forearm her girls against the
    perils they have already encountered. &ldquo;Have neither fancy
    nor curiosity to seek for extraordinary reading and <i>ragouts
    d&rsquo;oraison</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is a great difference between knowing
    God through learning, by the <i>point of the mind</i>, by the
    subtlety of reason, by the multiplicity of studies, and knowing
    Him through the simple instructions of Christianity.&rdquo; Between
    those lines I seem to read, &ldquo;Above all, not much
    Racine and no more Fénelon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly, it was a high idea that the Dames de Saint-Louis
    were destined to bring up young ladies to be mothers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> families and to take part in the good education of their children,
    thus placing in their hands a portion of the future of France
    and of religion. &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; says Mme. de Maintenon, &ldquo;in
    this work of Saint-Louis, if properly done in a spirit of true
    faith and a real love of God, the wherewithal to renew
    throughout this kingdom the perfection of Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foundress reminds them in so many words that, being
    at the gates of Versailles as they are, there is no medium
    for them between a very strict or a very scandalous establishment.
    &ldquo;Make your parlours inaccessible to all superfluous
    visits. Do not fear to seem a little stern, but do not
    be haughty.&rdquo; She counsels a more absolute humility than
    she is able to obtain. &ldquo;Reject the name of Dames [ladies]
    and take pleasure in calling yourselves the Daughters of
    Saint-Louis.&rdquo; She particularly insists on this virtue of
    humility, which is always the weak side of the Institution.
    &ldquo;You will preserve yourselves only by humility. You must
    expiate what there is of human grandeur in your foundation.&rdquo;
    Recognizing these conditions of society, Mme. de
    Maintenon gives this advice to a young girl leaving Saint-Cyr
    for the world: &ldquo;Never appear without the body of your
    gown (meaning in dishabille), and flee from all the other excesses
    common even to girls in the present day, such as too
    much eating, tobacco, hot liquors, too much wine, etc.; we
    have enough real needs without inventing others so useless
    and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In presence of a world that she knew so well, we must not
    think that Mme. de Maintenon tried to make tender plants,
    fragile women, ingenuously ignorant, with the morality of
    novices; she had, beyond all other persons, a profound sense
    of reality. She desired her &ldquo;Dames&rdquo; to speak boldly to
    their pupils on the marriage state; to show them the world
    and its divers conditions such as they are. &ldquo;Most nuns,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> she said, &ldquo;dare not utter the word &lsquo;marriage.&rsquo; Saint Paul had
    no such false delicacy, for he speaks of it very openly.&rdquo; She
    was the first to speak of it as an honourable, necessary, and
    hazardous state. &ldquo;When your young ladies have entered
    marriage they will find it is not a thing to laugh about.
    You should accustom them to speak of it seriously, even
    sadly, in a Christian manner; for it is the state in which we
    have most tribulations, even in the best marriage; they
    should be shown that three-fourths of all marriages are unhappy.&rdquo;
    As for celibacy, to which too many young girls
    might be condemned on leaving the Institution, for lack of a
    dowry (&ldquo;my greatest need,&rdquo; she says jestingly, &ldquo;is of sons-in-law&rdquo;),
    she thinks it an equally sad state. In general, no
    one has ever had fewer illusions than Mme. de Maintenon.
    Speaking of men, she thinks them rough and hard, &ldquo;little
    tender in their love when passion ceases to have sway.&rdquo; As
    for women, she has very fixed views of them, which are but
    moderately flattering. &ldquo;Women,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;only half know
    things, but the little they do know makes them usually conceited,
    disdainful, loquacious, and scornful of solid information.&rdquo;
    The education of Saint-Cyr, after its reform, had it
    always been carried out in Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s true spirit,
    would not have sinned through too much timidity, weakness,
    and tender grace; its austerity was only veiled.</p>
<p>The reform once established at Saint-Cyr and the first sad
    impression effaced, all became orderly, and joy returned as
    before to a life so uniform and busy. Mme. de Maintenon
    had, as I have said, the gift of education, and she would have
    no sadness about it; there never can be sadness in what is
    done thoroughly with a full heart in the right way; at one
    moment or at another, joy, which is but the expansion of
    the soul, returns and cannot cease to flow through actions.
    Mme. de Maintenon relied greatly on recreations to form her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> pupils pleasantly, to show them their defects and win their
    confidence without seeming to be in search of it. In the
    good she felt she had done at Saint-Cyr she dwelt much on
    the pains she had bestowed on &ldquo;recreation.&rdquo; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she
    said, &ldquo;is what leads to union and removes partialities; that
    is what binds the mistresses with the pupils; a superior
    makes herself liked and warms the hearts of her girls by
    giving them pleasures; that is the time when edifying things
    can be said without repelling, because we can mingle them
    with gayety; <i>many good maxims can be thrown out in jest</i>.&rdquo;
    She requires from the mistresses she has trained a talent for
    recreation as well as for teaching. &ldquo;Make your recreations
    gay and free, and your girls will come to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis XIV. at Saint-Cyr appears full of charm, of nobleness
    always, and sometimes with a certain <i>bonhomie</i> which
    he showed nowhere else. Under great events he intervened
    as king; when it was judged proper to reform the Constitution,
    he re-read it and approved it with his signature; when
    it becomes necessary to dismiss the recalcitrant mistresses,
    such as Mme. de La Maisonfort and some others, and to use
    for the purpose <i>lettres de cachet</i>, he, knowing that the heart
    of the other mistresses is wrung by this exile of their sisters,
    writes from the Camp at Compiègne to explain his rigour,
    and goes himself with a full cortège to the hall of the Community,
    where he holds a sort of <i>lit de justice</i> both regal and
    paternal. On his return from hunting he frequently came
    to find Mme. de Maintenon in this place of retreat, but never
    without taking time to put on, as he said, &ldquo;out of respect
    to these ladies, a decent coat.&rdquo; During the wars he remembers
    that he has at Saint-Cyr, in those young daughters
    of Saint-Louis and of the race of heroes, &ldquo;warrior spirits,
    religious souls, good Frenchwomen;&rdquo; and he asks for their
    prayers on days of disaster as on those of victory. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> knows that they mourn with him, and that his glory is their
    joy. All this new and private side of Louis XIV. is very
    delicately and generously touched by M. Lavallée; at certain
    passages we are surprised to find ourselves as much touched
    as the great monarch himself.</p>
<p>Louis XIV. and Mme. de Maintenon believed in the
    efficacy of prayer, especially that of Saint-Cyr. &ldquo;Make
    yourselves saints,&rdquo; says the foundress to her daughters
    repeatedly throughout the long series of calamitous wars,&mdash;&ldquo;make
    yourselves saints in order to gain us peace.&rdquo; And
    towards the end, when a ray of victory returned, she mingles
    a sort of gayety with the solemnity of her hope. &ldquo;It would
    be shameful in our Superior,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;if she could not
    raise the siege of Landrecies by force of prayers: it is for
    great souls to do great things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the last years of Louis XIV. Mme. de Maintenon
    was happy only when she could go to Saint-Cyr, &ldquo;to hide
    and comfort herself.&rdquo; She said it again and again, under all
    forms and in all tones: &ldquo;My great consoler is Saint-Cyr.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Vive
    Saint-Cyr! in spite of its defects one is better here
    than elsewhere in all the world.&rdquo; She had tasted of all and
    was surfeited of all. In spite of her dazzling position, and
    at the very summit, apparently, she was one of those delicate
    natures that are more sensitive to the secret animosities of
    the world than to its grosser offerings. Surrounded at Versailles
    by men who did not like her and by women she despised,
    reading their hearts through their self-interested
    homage and cringing baseness, worn-out with fatigue and
    constraint in presence of the king and the royal family, who
    used and abused her, she went to Saint-Cyr to relax, to
    moan, to let fall the mask that she wore perpetually. There
    she was respected, cherished, and obeyed; when absent, her
    letters read at recreation were the pride of the one who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> received them and the joy of all; when present, the mistresses
    and pupils concerted together to awaken her souvenirs
    and induce her to tell of her beginnings and the singular incidents
    of her fortune,&mdash;in short, to make her talk of herself;
    that topic to all of us so restful and so sweet. &ldquo;We love to
    talk of ourselves,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;were it even to say harm.&rdquo;
    But she never said harm.</p>
<p>If it is painful, as she said in after years, to last too long,
    to live in a society of persons who do not know us or the
    life that we have led in former days, who are, in short, of
    another epoch, it is nevertheless very pleasant to retreat to a
    garden bench and find ourselves surrounded by fresh young
    souls, docile in letting themselves be trained, and eager for
    all that we will say to them. Do not let us analyze too
    closely the various sentiments of Mme. de Maintenon at
    Saint-Cyr; suffice it to say that the effect on all who surrounded
    her was fruitful and good.</p>
<p>The language of Saint-Cyr has a tone apart amid that
    period of Louis XIV.; Mme. de Caylus was the mundane
    flower of it. We feel that &ldquo;Esther&rdquo; has passed that way,
    and Fénelon equally. The diction is that of Racine in prose,
    of Massillon, shorter and more sober,&mdash;a school, in fact, all
    pure, precise, and perfect (to which belonged the Duc du
    Maine); a charming source, more sparkling on the side of
    the women, though rather less fertile. At first it promised
    greater things; and to one of the Dames de Saint-Louis
    (Mme. de Chapigny) Mme. de Maintenon was able to write:
    &ldquo;I have never read anything so good, so charming, so clear,
    so well arranged, so eloquent, so regulated, in a word, so
    wonderful as your letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the death of Louis XIV. and under the harsh contrast
    with times so changed, Saint-Cyr passed, almost in an instant,
    to a state of antiquity and royal relic. After Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> death worthy inheritors of her rule continued to
    maintain for a long time the culture of suavity and intelligence;
    but the Dames de Saint-Louis were faithful, above
    all, to the intention of their foundress in never making themselves
    talked of. Respected by all, little liked by Louis
    XV., who thought them, as was natural, too lofty and too
    worthy of honour, they vanish from sight in the continuance
    of duty and the uniformity of their quiet existence. A letter
    of Horace Walpole, who visits them as an antiquary, another
    from the Chevalier de Boufflers, are the only noticeable testimony
    that we have about them in the course of many years.
    When the revolution of &rsquo;89 broke out, the astonishment in
    that valley so close to Versailles was great, much greater
    than elsewhere. Saint-Cyr had made itself so completely <i>immobile</i> in its past that it fell abruptly from Mme. de Maintenon
    to Mirabeau.</p>
<p>From that time, after the abolition of the titles of nobility,
    there seemed no uncertainty except as to the precise day on
    which the Institution should perish. Nevertheless, the
    Dames de Saint-Louis made a long and placid resistance,
    which maintained them in their House till 1793; they accomplished
    and verified to the letter Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s unconscious
    prediction when she said: &ldquo;Your institution can
    never fail so long as there is a king in France.&rdquo; It perished
    on the morrow of the day when there was no king.</p>
<p>But see and wonder at the linking of fates: Among
    the young ladies who were being educated at Saint-Cyr at
    that date was Marie-Anne de Buonaparte, born at Ajaccio,
    January 3, 1771, and received at the Institution in June,
    1784. Her brother Napoléon de Buonaparte, an officer of
    artillery, observing that after August 10 the decrees of the
    Legislative Assembly seemed to announce, or rather to confirm,
    the ruin of the house, went to that house on the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> of September 1, 1792, and took such active steps towards
    the mayor of the village and the administrators of Versailles
    that he was enabled on the same day to take away his
    sister (of whom he was the guardian) and carry her to his
    family in Corsica. He was destined not to return to Saint-Cyr,
    converted by him into a French Prytaneum, until June
    28, 1805, when as Emperor and master of all France he
    gazed&mdash;an equal to an equal&mdash;on Louis XIV.</p>
<p>In 1793 the devastated Saint-Cyr lost for a time its very
    name, and the ruined village was called Val-Libre. In 1794,
    while persons were converting the church into a hospital,
    the tomb of Mme. de Maintenon was discovered in the choir,
    broken open, the coffin violated, and her remains insulted.
    On that day, at least, she was treated as a queen.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>[Mme. de Maintenon was a voluminous letter-writer;
    many hundreds of her letters are published, the most interesting
    of which are those to the Princesse des Ursins. Her
    style is simple, easy, and dignified; not graphic nor lifelike;
    she seems too rounded into her own mind and views to be
    a good general observer; nor is she guided in her judgment
    of others by a perception of their feelings, unless they are
    reflected by her own. This remark does not apply to the
    Saint-Cyr letters; in those she is genuine, she is writing on
    a topic that fills her heart and opens it to others. Saint-Cyr
    was an episode in Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s life, and as such
    it can be placed here with some completeness. The last
    chapter of this volume contains a few miscellaneous letters
    bearing more especially upon the character and career of the
    Duchesse de Bourgogne, which Sainte-Beuve asserts can only
    be truly known through the letters of Mme. de Maintenon
    to the Princesse des Ursins.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>
<p>The pupils of Saint-Cyr were divided into four classes
    named and distinguished by the colour of their ribbons.
    Class Red (the youngest) were from seven to ten years of
    age; class Green from ten to fourteen; class Yellow from
    fourteen to seventeen; class Blue from seventeen to twenty.
    Certain young ladies of class Blue were detailed as head
    monitors and wore black ribbons; other monitors selected
    from classes Blue and Yellow wore flame-coloured ribbons.
    The classes were divided into bands or &ldquo;families&rdquo; of ten.
    Each class had a head mistress and three sub-mistresses;
    there were also two mistresses for the postulants or novices,
    two for the infirmary, others for the various departments of
    the house, and a mistress-general for the whole school.
    These mistresses were called &ldquo;Dames de Saint-Louis&rdquo; and
    were under vows; they were recruited by postulants selected
    from class Blue; the Superior was chosen by election among
    themselves from their own body. Mme. de Brinon, the first
    Superior, who came with the school from Rueil and Noisy,
    was an Ursuline nun.</p>
<p>After Mme. de Brinon, the Dames de Saint-Louis who
    were most relied upon by Mme. de Maintenon were: Mme.
    du Pérou, mistress of the novices at twenty years of age,
    afterwards elected many times as Superior; Mme. de
    Fontaines, mistress-general, also frequently elected Superior;
    and Mme. de Glapion, called the &ldquo;Pearl of Saint-Cyr,&rdquo; who
    seems to have been Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s most trusted
    friend, to whom she made personal confidences. Many
    letters and &ldquo;talks&rdquo; addressed to these ladies and others at
    Saint-Cyr have been published, from which those that here
    follow are selected.]</p>

<h3>LETTERS TO THE DAMES DE SAINT-CYR AND OTHERS.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>To M. l&rsquo;Abbé Gobelin</i> [her confessor].</p>
<p class="sig"> <span class="smcap">Chambord</span>, October 10, 1685.<br />
</p>
<p>I am very glad that you are satisfied with what you have
    seen at Noisy, and you will give me very great pleasure by
    going there again before the cold weather; but I would like
    you to confess, or at any rate converse in private with, all
    those who desire to enter our community. I have sent
    word to Mme. de Brinon to examine them all, and to begin
    nothing for the novitiate until my return. [This refers to
    the selection of mistresses, not pupils, for the establishment
    on its removal to Saint-Cyr.]</p>
<p>When you go again, I beg you to make a few familiar
    exhortations to the whole community. I approve, with you,
    that these ladies should make a year&rsquo;s trial, but it seems to
    me that it would be more useful if, instead of shutting
    them up to learn the rule and only know their obligations
    by speculation, they were to spend that year in performing
    the duties they will afterwards have to fulfil; above all,
    those of governing and instructing children, which is the
    foundation of the Institution.</p>
<p>I know well that this must not be done so exclusively
    that they will have no time for prayer, orisons, silence, acts,
    and conferences; but a mingling might be made which
    would make known to others, and also to themselves, of
    what they are capable. Concern yourself about this affair, I
    beg of you, inasmuch as you hope it may be useful; since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> God and the king have laid it upon me, you ought to help
    me to acquit myself well.</p>
<p>Humility cannot be preached too strongly, both in public
    and in private, to our postulants; for I fear that Mme. de
    Brinon may inspire them with a certain grandeur which
    she has herself, and that the neighbourhood of the Court,
    this royal foundation, the visits of the king and mine, may
    give them the idea of being chanoinesses, or important
    persons; which would not fail to swell their hearts, and
    counteract strongly the good we are seeking to do. All the
    rest is going on, it seems to me, very well; there is a very
    solid piety in the house; but we must take a medium course
    between the true splendour of our devotion and the puerilities
    and pettiness of convents, which we have tried to avoid. I
    do not yet know by what name the community will be
    called. If you have read the Constitution you will have
    seen that Mme. de Brinon calls them &ldquo;Dames de Saint-Louis.&rdquo;
    But this could hardly be, for the king would not
    canonize himself, and it is he who will name them when
    founding them. [They were so named, however.] They
    wish to be called Dames to distinguish them from the young
    ladies; send me your opinion on this. As for their costume,
    it must be black, of a shape now worn, but without hair, or
    any adornment; such, I think, as Saint Paul demands for
    Christian widows. Adieu; write to me, I entreat you, whenever
    you can do so without inconvenience.</p>

<p>I am very glad to be in communication with you, Mademoiselle,
    and I judge by the office Mme. de Brinon has
    given you that she thinks you have much benevolence and
    exactitude. You can address yourself to me for all your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> wants, asking, however, only for those it is impossible to
    avoid having; for as you will have everything new at Saint-Cyr
    you must be patient at Noisy. When you write to me
    again, leave rather more interval between your lines, that I
    may correct your orthography on days when I have leisure;
    the best way of learning to spell is to copy books. Your
    handwriting is very handsome, and I see with pleasure that
    several of the novices write very well. I am now going to
    correct your letter, but I shall not finish mine without assuring
    you of my esteem and friendship.</p>
<p>Take care to notice the difference between my corrections
    and what you have written; for that is how you will learn
    better.</p>

<p>They are working hard about Saint-Cyr. Your Constitution
    and rules have been examined; they have been admired,
    cut down, and added to. Pray God that he will inspire all
    those who touch them. I must inform you of a visit I have
    received from the king this morning; he is none the better
    for it; still we were delighted to see him out of his room.
    [Louis XIV. had lately undergone a surgical operation.] He
    has corrected the choir of Saint-Cyr, and several other parts;
    the young ladies are to be placed on four benches as at
    Noisy; therefore we must again change the colours. He
    talked yesterday with the controller-general about the foundation,
    and all will be settled soon. One never has all good
    things at once; proximity to Versailles will give you many
    advantages and as many restraints; praise God for all things.
    I shall go, please God, to Noisy next Sunday and give you
    an account of all that has then happened.</p>
<p>Rejoice, my very dear; you are spending your life for God
    and a great work.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To the Dames de Saint-Louis.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> August 1, 1686.<br />
</p>
<p>God having willed to use me to assist in this establishment
    which the king undertakes for the education of poor
    young ladies in his kingdom, I think I ought to communicate
    to the persons destined to bring them up what my
    experience has taught me about the means of giving a good
    education; to do that is assuredly one of the greatest austerities
    that can be practised, because there is no other without
    some relaxation; whereas in the education of children
    the whole life must be employed upon it.</p>
<p>When the object is merely to adorn their memories, it
    suffices to instruct them for a few hours a day,&mdash;it would
    even be a great imprudence to burden them longer; but
    when we seek to form their reason, waken their hearts, elevate
    their minds, destroy their evil inclinations, in a word,
    make them know and love virtue, we must always be at
    work, for at all moments opportunities present themselves.
    We are just as important to pupils in their amusements as
    in their lessons, and we cannot leave them for a moment
    except to their injury.</p>
<p>As it is not possible that a single person can conduct a
    large number of children, it will be necessary to have several
    mistresses for each class; but they must act together in great
    union and with the very greatest uniformity of sentiments;
    their maxims must be alike, and they must endeavour to
    instil them with the same manners.</p>
<p>In this employment, more than in any other, there is need
    to forget one&rsquo;s self entirely; or, at least, if any credit is hoped
    for it must only be after success, using the simplest means
    to obtain it. When I say that we must forget ourselves
    I mean that we must aim only to make ourselves understood
    and thus convince; eloquence must be abandoned, for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> may attract the admiration of listeners; it is even well to
    play with, children on certain occasions and make them love
    us in order to acquire a power over them by which they will
    profit. But we must make no mistake as to the means we
    may use to make ourselves loved; none but upright intentions
    will draw down the blessing of God.</p>
<p>We should think less of adorning their minds than of
    forming their reason; this system, it is true, makes the
    knowledge and ability of the mistresses less apparent; a
    young girl who knows a thousand things by heart will shine
    in company and gratify her relatives more than one whose
    judgment has been formed, who knows how to be silent,
    who is modest and reserved, and is in no haste to show her
    cleverness.</p>
<p>It is right to let them sometimes follow their own will
    in order to know their inclinations, to teach them the difference
    between what it good, what is bad, and what is indifferent.
    I think that all persons who give themselves
    the trouble to read this will know as well as I what is
    meant by indifferent things. Give them, for instance, one
    companion in place of another; a walk in one direction
    rather than in another, a game or other trifles, to let them
    see we are only mistresses when we must be, and that they
    might be so themselves in all things if they were reasonable.
    A companion may be dangerous, a walk may have some
    impropriety, a game may be out of place; but I wish that
    in refusing them they be told the reason, as far as prudence
    will allow, trying always to grant them frequently what
    they want, in order to refuse what is bad with a firmness
    that never yields. It is wonderful how much such methods
    make governing easy and absolute.</p>
<p>It is good to accustom them to have nothing granted to
    importunity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>You must be implacable on vices, and punish them either
    by shame or by chastisements, which must be very rigorous,
    but as rare as possible.</p>
<p>Guard yourselves from the dangerous principle of some
    persons who, out of a scrupulous fear that God will be offended,
    avoid all occasions when children&rsquo;s inclinations can
    appear; we cannot know too much about them in order to
    inspire a horror of vice and a love of virtue, in which we
    should confirm the young by giving them principles which
    will prevent their going wrong through ignorance. We
    should study their inclinations, observe their tempers, and
    follow their little contests in order to train them in every
    way. For experience shows us only too well how often
    faults are committed without knowing it, and how many
    persons fall into crime without being more wicked than
    others who live innocently.</p>
<p>They should be taught all the delicacies of honour, integrity,
    discretion, generosity, and humanity; and virtue should
    be described to them as being both beautiful and agreeable, as
    it is. A few little stories suited to this purpose will be very
    proper and useful,&mdash;amusing, yet all the while instructing
    them; but they must be convinced that if virtue does not
    have religion for its basis it is not solid, and God will not
    sustain it, but will rebuke such pagan and heroic virtues,
    which are only the result of susceptible pride insatiable for
    praise.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to make long disquisitions on such
    matters; it is better to place them as occasions occur.</p>
<p>You must make yourselves esteemed by the children;
    and the only means of doing so is not to show them defects;
    for it is hard to believe how intelligent they are in perceiving
    them. The study to appear perfect in their eyes is of
    great utility to ourselves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>
<p>Never scold them from ill-humour, and never give them
    reason to think there are times more favourable than others
    to obtain what they want. Treat fine natures with affection,
    be stern with bad ones, but harsh with none. Make them
    like the presence of their mistresses through amiable kindness,
    and let them do before you exactly what they would
    do if left alone.</p>
<p>We should enter into the amusements of children, but
    never adapt ourselves to them by childish language or
    puerile ways; and as they cannot be too reasonable, or too
    soon be made so, we should accustom children to reason
    from the moment they can talk and understand,&mdash;all the
    more because they will never reject the healthy amusements
    we give them.</p>
<p>The external accomplishments of foreign languages and
    the thousand other things with which young ladies of quality
    are expected to be adorned have their inconveniences;
    for such studies are apt to take time which might be more
    usefully employed. The young ladies of the house of Saint-Louis
    ought not to be brought up, more than can be helped,
    in that way; because, being without property, it is not well to
    uplift their hearts and minds in a manner so little suitable
    to their fortunes and state of life.</p>
<p>But Christianity and reason, which are all that we wish to
    inspire, are equally good for princesses and paupers; and if
    our young ladies profit by what I believe they will be taught,
    they will be capable of sustaining all the good and all the
    evil that God may be pleased to send them.</p>

<p class="sig"> October 25, 1686.<br />
</p>
<p>I am convinced of your zeal and your capacity; and both
    must be employed for our dear house. It is true that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> very keen for all its interests; I think I sometimes go as
    far as impatience; but it seems to me that there are reasons
    why we should hasten, and use well the favourable moment
    in which we now are. God knows that I never thought to
    make so grand an establishment as yours, and that I had no
    other view than to do a few good works during my lifetime;
    not feeling myself obliged to do more, and thinking that
    there were already too many nunneries. The less part I
    had in this plan, the more I see in it the will of God; which
    makes me love it much more than if it were my own work.
    God has led the king to found this school, as you know,
    although he does not like new institutions.</p>
<p>It is true that just as much as I should have trembled in
    governing Saint-Cyr had it been my own work, so much on
    the other hand do I find myself emboldened by the sense
    that it is done by the will of God, and that that same will
    has laid this duty upon me. Therefore I can say to you
    with truth that I regard it as the means God has granted
    me for my salvation, and that I would sacrifice my life with
    joy to make it glorious. What is now urging me on, sometimes
    perhaps too eagerly, is the desire I have that all should
    be firmly established before the death of Mme. de Brinon,
    my own, and that of the Abbé de Gobelin, so that the spirit
    of the house may always last, in spite of oppositions it may
    meet with in the future. You will never have an abler or
    more commanding Superior than Mme. de Brinon, a friend
    more zealous for the house than I, a director more saintly
    than the one you have now.</p>
<p>We have, moreover, all authority, temporal and spiritual, in
    our hands. The king and the bishop [Godet of Chartres]
    are ready to do all that we desire; it is for us to put things
    in that state of perfection in which we desire them to remain
    forever.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>
<p>In examining your girls [for the novitiate] seek for true
    piety, an upright mind, the liking they may have for the
    Institute, the desire they have to be useful, their attachment
    to the rules, their spirit of community, their detachment
    from the world; these are the principal things for a Dame
    de Saint-Louis. As for tempers a little too quick, remember
    that we all have the vices and virtues of our temperament;
    that which makes us hasty makes us active, vigilant, eager
    for the success of what we undertake; that which makes us
    gentle makes us nonchalant, lazy, indifferent, slow, insensible;
    piety rectifies both in the long run, and surely that
    is the essential thing. Who can be hastier than Mme. de
    Brinon and I? but do you love us less? You will tell me,
    perhaps, and with reason, that subordinates suffer from such
    tempers; to that I reply that everybody has to suffer; and,
    after all, you will only have such Superiors as you elect
    yourselves. But while I excuse hasty people (from self-love
    perhaps), I exhort you to correct that disposition as much as
    you possibly can in your novices.</p>
<p>You can show what I write to you to whom you please;
    would to God it were good enough that all might draw some
    profit from it.</p>

<p class="sig"> December, 1690.<br />
</p>
<p>I have heard of your disobedience to Mme. de Labarre, and
    I have stopped the punishment they intended to give you.
    How can you suppose that we should allow such rebellion?
    What exception could there be to our rules? Do you think
    yourself necessary because you have a fine voice? Can you
    know me and yet think that the representation of &ldquo;Athalie&rdquo;
    goes before the regulations established at Saint-Cyr? No,
    certainly not; and you will leave the establishment if I hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> anything more about you. Submit, if you wish to remain;
    but, if you wish to leave, it will be more honourable to you to
    do so by agreement with me than to get yourself dismissed.
    You are lax and cold towards God; it is that which makes
    you fall into all these faults. Reflect, I beg of you, on what
    you might hope of yourself on the occasions which you
    will find to fail. You are becoming grown-up; this is the
    time to make serious reflections. It is for God, my dear
    child, to touch your heart, but it is for us to rule your conduct.
    You will be very unhappy if it is good only externally.
    I wished to give you this advice before punishing you, and I
    hope that you will give me the joy of seeing you profit by
    it; I ask this of you with all my heart; for I am as sorry
    to have to treat you with rigour as I am resolved to establish
    in your class an absolute obedience to the regulations.</p>

<p class="sig"> September 20, 1691.<br />
</p>
<p>The pain I feel about the daughters of Saint-Cyr can only
    be relieved by time and by a total change in the education
    we have given them up to this time. It is very just that I
    should suffer because I have contributed to the harm more
    than any one; I shall be happy if God does not punish me
    more severely. My pride has been in everything concerning
    the establishment; and its depth is so great it carries the
    day against my own good intentions. God knows that I
    wanted to establish virtue at Saint-Cyr, but I have built on
    sand,&mdash;not having that which alone can make a firm foundation.
    I wanted that the girls should have intelligence, that
    their hearts should be uplifted, their reason formed. I have
    succeeded in my purpose: they have intelligence, and they
    use it against us; their hearts are uplifted, and they are
    prouder and more haughty than is becoming in the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> princesses&mdash;speaking as the world thinks; we have formed
    their reason, and we have made them disputatious, presumptuous,
    inquisitive, bold, etc. Thus it is that we succeed when
    the desire of excelling [shining] makes us act. A simple,
    Christian education would have made good girls, out of
    whom we could have made good wives and good nuns; we
    have made <i>beaux-esprits</i>, whom we ourselves who made them
    cannot endure: there is our blame, in which I have a greater
    share than any one.</p>
<p>Let us come to the remedy; for we must not be discouraged.
    I have already proposed some to Balbien [Mme. de
    Maintenon&rsquo;s waiting-maid mentioned in &ldquo;Saint-Simon&rdquo; as
    Nanon]. They may seem to you rather petty, but I hope,
    by the grace of God, they will not be without effect. As
    many little things have fomented pride, so many little
    things will subdue it. Our girls have been too much considered,
    too petted, too often deferred to. They must now
    be ignored in their classes; they must be made to keep the
    rules of the day; and little else must be talked of. They
    should not be forced to feel that I am angry with them; it
    is not their grief that I want; I am more to blame than
    they; I desire only to repair by another line of conduct the
    harm that has been done. The best girls have done more to
    show me the excess of pride which we must now correct
    than the bad ones; I have been more alarmed at seeing their
    self-conceit and the arrogance of Mlles. de &mdash;&mdash;, de &mdash;&mdash;, and
    de &mdash;&mdash; than at all that I have heard of the insubordinate
    members of the class. These are girls of good intentions who
    wish to be nuns, but with that desire they have a language
    and manners too proud and haughty to be tolerated at Versailles
    among young ladies of the highest rank. You see by
    this that the evil has sunk into their natures, so that they are
    not themselves aware of it. Pray God, and make others pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> that He will change their hearts, and give us all humility.
    But, madame, do not discourse to them too much. All Saint-Cyr
    is turning to discourses; much is said there just now of
    simplicity; they seek to define it, to comprehend it, to discern
    what is simple and what is not; and then in practice they
    say: &ldquo;Out of simplicity, I take the best thing; out of simplicity
    I praise myself; out of simplicity I want something at
    table that is far away from me.&rdquo; Truly, this is turning into
    ridicule all that is most serious. We must now correct in
    our girls that turn for witty satire which I myself have
    given them, and which I now see to be opposed to simplicity;
    it is a refinement of pride that says in jest what it dares not
    say openly. But, once more, do not talk to them of pride
    or satire; we must destroy all that without fighting it, by
    stopping the use of it; their confessors will talk to them of
    humility better than we. Do not preach to them,&mdash;try that
    silence that I have so long urged upon you; it will have
    more effect than all our words.</p>
<p>I am very glad that Mlle. de &mdash;&mdash; has at last humbled herself;
    let us praise God for it, but do not praise her; it is
    another of our faults that we have praised too much. Do not
    irritate their pride by too frequent corrections; but when
    you are obliged to make one, do not admire the girl who is
    corrected for taking it properly.</p>
<p>As for you, my dear daughter, I know your intentions;
    you have, it seems to me, no personal blame in all this; it is
    only too true that the great harm has come from me; but
    take care, with the others, to have no part in that pride
    which has been so firmly established everywhere that we
    are scarcely conscious of it. We wanted to avoid the pettiness
    of certain convents, and God has punished our assumption.
    There is no house in the world more in need of
    external and internal humility than ours: its situation so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> near the Court, its grandeur, its wealth, its nobleness, the air
    of favour that pervades it, the attentions of a great king, the
    care of a person of influence, the example of vanity and
    manners of the world which she gives you in spite of herself
    by force of habit,&mdash;all these dangerous traps ought to
    make us take measures quite the contrary of those we have
    hitherto taken. Let us bless God for having opened our
    eyes. It is he who inspires your piety; it will daily increase;
    but establish it solidly. Let us not be ashamed to
    retract; to change our fashions of acting and speaking; and
    let us ask our Lord fervently to change our hearts within us,
    to take from our house the spirit of loftiness, of satire, of
    subtlety, of curiosity, and of freedom in judging and giving
    our opinion about everything, and of meddling in the duties
    of others at the risk of wounding charity. Let us pray also
    that He will take from us that prevailing over-delicacy, that
    impatience of small inconveniences; silence and humility
    are the best means. Show my letter to our Mother Superior;
    all must be in common among us.</p>

</p>
<p>Do not be disturbed by the complaints made to you [by
    the mistresses] of your children; think only of training
    their hearts to piety, integrity, simplicity, candour, sincerity,
    honesty, and courage, and you will one day see, if it pleases
    God, that they are far removed from the children you now
    write of.</p>
<p>Do not notice all the faults of the Yellows and Blues;
    have patience; all will come right in time, and the sisters
    will be better convinced by their own experience than by
    anything we can say to them. As for what you have done
    about silence, nothing could be better. I only beg you, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> have already said, to preach it without expecting to fully
    obtain it. You will never succeed in keeping sixty girls
    together without a word from one of them. You must see
    things as they are, and not attack a small infringement like
    a vice. Regularity and silence are necessary for the quiet,
    the order, and the propriety of the house; but the essential
    part of the education of your girls is that they shall bear
    with them and always practise the virtues I have named to
    you. Those virtues do not show to persons who merely see
    a march in the choir or a silent recreation in the class-room;
    but it is this sincerity of purpose that I ask of you; God will
    reward it magnificently.</p>
<p>I should be afraid to write all this to certain of the Dames,
    who, with very good intentions, pass from one extreme to
    the other at the least word said to them, and who on the
    strength of this letter would cease to attend to regularity
    or silence; but I hope that you at least will understand me
    better.</p>

<p>When you wish to know anything, madame, it is better
    that I should write it to you than say it, because it is then
    impossible that either of us should forget it. I am at your
    service for whatever you want; and I will now repeat what
    I think I have already said to you.</p>
<p>You must punish as seldom as you possibly can, and for
    this reason you must not see all faults. But when you cannot
    ignore those you have seen, you must not pardon them
    if they are considerable, or if they have already been
    pardoned. It is now a question of bringing the young ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> to a footing of perfect obedience. To this you must apply
    yourself seriously, without, however, searching out those
    faults that you could ignore....</p>
<p>Get it into your mind, once for all, that there are few circumstances
    in life without their drawbacks, and that you
    must choose the side that has the least. You must also distinguish
    clearly those that disturb order and the public good;
    that is what we must especially avoid in communities.</p>
<p>Yes, madame, you will have the necessary courage if you
    ask it of God, if you act in His presence and for Him solely;
    or I should better say, if you forget yourself entirely, without
    thinking whether you will be loved or hated. If you punish
    without prejudice, without listening to your repugnances or
    your inclinations, if you can think that you please God,
    whatever you do, and are conscious that you seek good only
    without respect to persons,&mdash;if you govern with those dispositions,
    as I do not doubt you will, our Lord will govern
    with you. Pray to Him, I implore you, for those who are
    guiding you.</p>

    own daughter. [The child was only nine years old at the
    time this letter was written.] I do not know if it is you
    who inspire the pride your companions have, or whether it
    is they who have given theirs to you; however that may be,
    rely upon it that you will be intolerable to God and men if
    you do not become more humble and more modest than you
    are. You take a tone of authority which will never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> becoming in you, happen what may. You think yourself a
    person of importance because you are fed and lodged in a
    house where the king comes daily; but the day after my
    death neither the king nor all those who caress you now will
    look at you. If that should happen before you are married,
    you will have a very poor country gentleman for a husband
    because you are not rich; and if during my life you should
    marry a greater seigneur, he would only consider you, after
    my death, as long as your humour was agreeable to him;
    you would be valued only for your gentleness, and of that
    you have none. Your <i>mignonne</i> [term used in those days
    for an attendant on girls] loves you too much, and does not
    see you as other people see you. I am not prejudiced against
    you, for I love you much, but I cannot see without pain the
    pride that appears in all you do. You are assuredly very disagreeable
    to God; consider His example. You know the
    Gospel by heart; and what good will such learning do you
    if you are lost like Lucifer? Remember that it is solely the
    fortune of your aunt that has made that of your father and
    yourself. You allow persons to pay you a respect that is not
    due to you; you will not suffer being told that it is only
    paid on my account; you would like to raise yourself above
    me, so proud and lofty are you. How do you reconcile that
    puffed-up heart with the pious devotion in which you are
    being brought up? Begin by asking of God humility, contempt
    for yourself,&mdash;who are, in truth, nothing at all,&mdash;and
    the esteem of your neighbours. I speak to you as if you were
    a great girl because you have a very advanced mind; but I
    would consent with all my heart to your having less, and
    therefore less presumption.</p>
<p>If there is anything in my letter that you do not understand
    your <i>mignonne</i> will explain it to you. I pray Our
    Lord to change you so that I may on my return find you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> modest, humble, timid, and putting into practice what you
    know to be right. I shall love you much more. I conjure
    you by the affection you have for me to work upon yourself
    and to pray daily for the graces of which you are in need.</p>

<p>The mother of the Demoiselles de &mdash;&mdash; has been beheaded;
    I shall always reproach myself for not following up that
    case with a care which might have saved the life of the
    poor creature. God has disposed otherwise. I am awaiting
    you before announcing this sad news to the two daughters.
    I am requested to consult the king on sending them away
    from Saint-Cyr. He does not understand any more than I do
    why this crime should be visited on the children, and I conjure
    you to reflect still further upon it with the Bishop of Chartres
    and the Abbé Tiberge. They say that the Jesuits would not
    admit to their Society in a like case, nor the nuns of the Visitation
    either. If that spirit comes from Saint Ignatius or Saint
    François de Sales, I submit to it without repugnance, but if
    it is only the effect of human wisdom or the harshness of
    communities, I desire with all my heart to escape it in this
    case. The father of M. de Luxembourg was beheaded; but
    they confided to the latter the person of the king and his
    armies. We saw M. de Rohan die upon the scaffold some
    twenty years ago, and all his family were in offices round
    the king and queen, and receiving condolences on the event
    without its entering the head of a single courtier to speak
    against them. What! shall worldly decency go farther than
    charity? Shall we fail to give our pupils the true ideas they
    ought to have on all things? I am told that in the classes
    these girls will meet with less respect and be exposed to reproaches:
    I should put that act among the most punishable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> of faults; girls with proper hearts would be incapable of it;
    the others must be corrected....</p>
<p>I say all this for justice, and from the desire I have that
    our girls should have their minds and their hearts right, for
    it may very well be that the girls in question are not
    suitable for us. I do not need, monsieur, to commend them
    to your charity; I pray God to console and bless them.</p>

<p>Madame, I have always forgotten to ask you why they
    continue to serve the young ladies with rye bread in days
    when wheat is no longer dear. It was very proper that
    they should learn by their own experience the inequality of
    the riches of the world, and take some share in the public
    sufferings; but they ought to be put back into the usual
    system when there is no reason to keep them out of it. The
    tendency of communities is to retrench on food, rather than
    on commodities or embellishments which they ought to go
    without. As our nourishment is simple and frugal, nothing
    should touch it. The girls are murmuring in their hearts
    much more bitterly than they dare say. I try in everything
    to help you with my experience.</p>
<p>Do not think, either for yourself or for your girls, that
    those who do not feel dull have no need of relaxation.
    Serious occupations wear upon us, little by little, without our
    perceiving it until too late; that is why, my dear daughter,
    you ought to prevent such a result by diversions of the
    mind that are innocent. Take care only that nothing passes
    contrary to religious modesty, nothing worldly, nothing
    excited or excessive; but that gentleness, holy liberty,
    simplicity, charity, modesty reign in everything. I wish no
    dancing.</p>

<p>Profit, I conjure you, for yourself and for others by the
    experience you have just had of quinine. Nothing is more
    unreasonable than notions; our age assumes them about
    everything; they decide all things; there is no one who does
    not seek to be a doctor, or meddle in the direction of affairs;
    all have decided opinions; women pretend to judge of books,
    sermons, governments, of the spiritual and the bodily;
    modesty is no longer in usage. No one ever replies now,
    &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It is not for me to judge;&rdquo; no one is
    baffled; the place of knowledge and judgment is filled by
    intolerable presumption, for never were persons more ignorant.
    Do not have, or allow that quality in your midst.
    Say out, simply, that you do not know. Let yourselves be
    guided by confessors, doctors, superiors, magistrates, the
    king; inspire that modesty in your novices, to whom this
    letter is as necessary as to you.</p>
<p>I am delighted that the Reds desire to please me; what

</p>
<p>Complaint is made, my dear daughter, that you do not
    give enough little comforts to the classes. You want me
    to speak to you freely and I shall do so. I think it true
    that you are too stern about expenses and all sorts of
    economy. Consider, I beg of you, that the most important
    thing in your case is not to save a thousand francs more or
    less (and the favours asked of you would not cost more than
    that), but to firmly establish and cause to be liked your rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> as Superior; and you can do it in no better way than by
    entering, not only into the just needs of your community,
    but even into some wants that are not altogether necessary.</p>
<p>When certain of the mistresses ask me for ribbon for use
    in representing the tragedies, and I give it, do you not think
    that I do better than if I replied dryly that my money
    would be better employed in giving alms? Am I not doing
    a much greater good by this compliance to the mistresses of
    the different classes? They are pleased; and it is just to
    soften their labour; we make their young ladies like them,
    and so dispose them to receive instruction; the latter will
    open their hearts themselves to those who grant them these
    attentions. Nevertheless, you refuse them twenty pairs of
    gloves, or you deduct those gloves from the next distribution;
    do you not see, my dear daughter, that to save ten
    francs you have vexed sixteen of your mistresses? Saint-François
    de Sales sent Mme. de Chantal word as to a lawsuit
    she had gained which he did not wish her to undertake.
    &ldquo;This time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have been more just than kind;
    I would rather have you more kind than just.&rdquo; Apply those
    words to yourself, and be more kind than saving, more
    careful than thrifty; make yourself beloved, and in that way
    you will do a solid good to the establishment. Keep your
    negatives for all that is against the regulations; never relax
    there, but even there you can make answers that will not be
    harsh by saying: &ldquo;The Constitution forbids that; the rules
    point to this,&rdquo; and so on. But for details within those lines,
    I beg you to give ear to what the mistresses request, leaning
    to compliance rather than severity. I pray God to give
    you the courage of which you have need to fulfil your duties,
    and an extension of charity and perception which will make
    you prefer great duties to little ones.</p>

<p>We should have an equitable not a superficial charity.
    For instance, we should rid ourselves of a girl who would be
    capable of corrupting others, without listening to the sentiments
    of a weak compassion which would lead us to say:
    &ldquo;But she is so poor; what will her family do? she will be
    ruined in the world.&rdquo; Better that she should be lost alone
    than ruin your whole establishment. For certain defects
    which cannot injure others and only make you suffer yourself,
    I exhort you to have infinite patience; how many we
    have known who were bad and are now among our best
    girls! I was listening to one the other day with great
    pleasure as she told me with humility and simplicity the
    evil inclinations that might have led her to bad ways, and
    yet she has done marvels. Such cases ought to encourage
    you and make you see that if there are some pains in educating
    there are also many grounds for consolation.</p>
<p>I entreat you to tell my sister de Riancourt that she must
    give good nourishment to the sick, take great care that they
    rest well, warm them in their chills, and dry them if they
    perspire. But easy chairs in which they lounge all day,
    loose dressing-gowns without belts like fashionable women,
    soups without bread crumbs, such things, I say, are delicacies
    out of all proportion with the illnesses I have known
    you have, so far. Read her this part of my letter, I beg of
    you, and bind her conscience to establish the infirmary on
    the footing of religious charity but with none of that laxness
    which ought not to be allowed among your young ladies.</p>

    when she ought to be talking with her daughters. You are

<p>It has seemed to me as if you desired that I should write
    to you on all things that might be of consequence to your
    establishment. I place in that rank the representations of
    the beautiful tragedies I caused to be written for you,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and
    which may in the future be imitated. My object was to
    avoid the miserable compositions of nuns, such as I saw at
    Noisy. I thought it was judicious and necessary to amuse
    children; I have always seen it done in places where they
    are collected; but I wished while amusing those of Saint-Cyr
    to fill their minds with fine things of which they would
    not be ashamed when they entered the world; I wished to
    teach them to pronounce properly; to occupy them in a way
    that would withdraw them from conversations with one
    another, and especially to amuse the elder ones, who from
    fifteen to twenty years of age get rather weary of the life at
    Saint-Cyr. These are my reasons for still continuing the
    representations, provided your superiors [meaning the
    Bishop of Chartres and the confessors] do not forbid them.
    But you must keep them entirely confined to your own
    house, and never let them be seen by outside persons under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> any pretext whatever. It is always dangerous to allow men
    to see well-made girls who add to the charms of their person
    by acting well what they represent. Therefore do not, I
    say, permit the presence of any man, whoever he may be,
    poor, rich, young or old, priest or secular,&mdash;I would even say
    a saint, if there were such on earth. All that can be allowed,
    if one of the superiors [priests] insists on judging the
    performance, is to let the youngest children act a play before
    him&mdash;as, in fact, we have already done.</p>

<p>You admire too much what I do for your class, but nevertheless,
    such as it is you do not imitate it enough. You talk
    to your children with a stiffness, a gloominess, a brusqueness
    which will close their hearts. They should feel that
    you love them, that you are grieved by their faults for
    their own sake, and that you are full of hope that they will
    correct themselves; you should take them expertly, encourage
    them, praise them, in a word, employ all means
    except roughness&mdash;which will never lead any one to God.
    You are too rigidly of a piece, very proper to live with
    saints, but you ought to know how to adapt yourself, to be
    every sort of person, and especially a kind mother to a large
    family, all of whom are equally dear to her.</p>
<p>I have always forgotten to tell you that I noticed several
    days ago, in hearing you explain the Gospel, that you seem
    to me to embrace too many topics; children want but few.
    You also talk too much; I think you had better make the
    children talk more, so as to see if they have listened and
    understood. I likewise think that you are too eloquent.
    For example, you said to them that they must make an eternal
    divorce from sin; that is true, and well said, but I doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> if there are three girls in your class who know what a
    divorce is. Be simple, and think only of making yourself
    intelligible.</p>
<p>I think, my dear daughter, that you will consider it right
    that I should give you my opinion from time to time on
    what I see you do. Inspire your children, I conjure you,
    with the practices of piety, with a horror of sin, a sense of
    God&rsquo;s presence, and a docility in being led by you. I beg
    you also to guide them according to the spirit of the Church;
    as for this, I have written a little compendium which you
    must follow.</p>

    you again, my joy would be perfect if I could see you walking
    as straight without that great support; but I will have
    confidence in God and believe that the provision of strength
    you are making now will nourish you for the future.</p>
<p>The affection you feel for your girls will never harm you
    if you love them all equally; preferences would be ruinous
    to the class and to yourself; you must have none, except for
    the very best girls, and such preferences ought not to offend
    the others.</p>
<p>Why do you not ask of your class all that you know I

    that Saint-Cyr can do without me; what I should now do

    persons who have outlived the follies of youth, but for youth
    itself, which is dying of ennui because it wants to amuse
    itself continually and finds nothing to content that insatiable
    desire for pleasure. I toil at the oar to amuse Mme. la

    sought only to please God, to work and sing His praises, as

<p>Yes, my dear daughter, you must use simple language;
    a nun should rule that as she rules her eyes, her walk, and
    all her actions. We should feed on Holy Scripture, but not
    use its terms more than is necessary to make it understood.
    M. Fagon is often praised because he talks medically in so
    simple and intelligible a way that we think we see the
    things that he explains; a village doctor talks Greek. Explain
    to your girls what you find in the books you read to
    them; but tell them always they are never to use those
    words. In this our Mother and I are not aiming at any one
    in particular, only at the names you introduce; and from
    them we pass to learned words, in short, to that which may
    be called the pedantic spirit. We cannot endure this in

    ones and particularly in those of our sex! We should do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> very wrong, my dear daughter, to tell you this in a roundabout
    way; because, by the favour God has done you, we

<p>I think as you do about Saint-Cyr; and whatever reasons
    I may have to open the door to certain persons sometimes, I
    am always enchanted when they go out of it, and I never
    love Saint-Cyr so well as when it is its natural self. My
    sister de Radouay will tell you if that is flattery; she tells
    us many truths in a jesting way, and I should like, as she
    advises, to prepare you for the change you will some day
    feel; but I find difficulty in doing so, and I fall back on
    what wisdom has told us: &ldquo;Sufficient unto the day is the
    evil thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My intention was to answer all letters with my own
    hand, but I have so many things to do that I must husband
    myself from early morning in order to be able to go
    on till night; my sister de Fontaines would choke at the
    recital of my days; my restraints extend to everything.
    The letter of my sister de Jas has furnished me with many
    subjects of rejoicing in the account she gives me of her
    interior and her exterior; but those are subjects of confession,&mdash;they
    must not be answered. Our good mistress
    of the novices goes quietly to her ends; she asks me to
    send her a &ldquo;Conversation;&rdquo; if she saw me, she would not
    ask it. My poor mind is dragged apart by four horses;
    it is not yet eleven o&rsquo;clock, but my head feels bound with
    iron, and yet I must sustain my rôle as personage till ten
    at night.</p>
<p>I see no difficulty in putting Mlle. de Grouchy into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> novitiate; why not also Fontanges, who desires it so
    ardently? Their appearance is not charming, but we must
    accustom ourselves to value only that which God values.
    I am perfectly well so far as my general health is concerned;
    that is to say, I no longer have fever or weakness,
    but many rheumatic pains in my head as soon as I
    expose myself to cold.</p>

<p>We were interrupted a few days ago just as I was telling
    you, my dear daughter, what I have already written
    elsewhere, namely: when you have girls of high rank you
    must redouble your care for their education, but in a
    manner imperceptible to the others&mdash;for the equality that
    you keep is admirable. What I ask does not go further
    than wishing you to speak to them oftener in private,
    employing them in all that can open their minds, instilling
    into them a solid piety and whatever can form their hearts
    to virtue. Those girls, when they go into the world, or
    even into convents, can do greater good than others who
    are forced by poverty to return to their parents. Mlle.
    de Rochechouart is a case in point; it seems to me that
    you push her enough; I hope that her inclinations respond
    to her birth.</p>
<p>You say you have had difficulty in combining two things
    that I asked of you, and which you find opposed to each
    other: one, that you ought to train, as much as you can,
    the consciences of your girls to be simple, open and direct;
    and the other, that you must not make them talkative.
    There is no contrariety, as I think, between the two things;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> it is never the frank who have the most to say. Frankness
    does not consist in saying much, but in saying all;
    and that all is quickly said when it is sincere, because
    there are no preambles, and no great number of words
    are needed to open the heart. A simple person says
    naïvely what is in her mind; if she should chance to be
    a little too diffuse, obedience calms her and four words
    are enough. Those who are not simple cannot resolve
    either to speak or hold their tongues; their confidences
    must be dragged from them; we lose ourselves in their
    twists and turns; that is what makes such long conversations
    and frequent confessions; they have said something,
    but not all; they were not willing to tell perhaps
    one circumstance, and then they are frightened at not
    having told it, and so they return to tell it and perhaps
    much else. Now an honest heart tells at once all it knows.
    Have you not observed that the frankest girls are the
    soonest confessed? They hide nothing, and the confessor,
    who knows their disposition, has little to say to them....</p>

    their instituters and founders, and against the charity they
    owe to the young ladies if they leave them at times when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> their regulations do not oblige them to be in church.
    That hunger for prayer is only self-love wanting to be
    pleased with itself for its works, and counting as nought
    that which is done under rules. How can they teach
    young ladies that duty should be done according to the
    place of each person if they themselves neglect the duty
    of theirs, which is the care of those young ladies? A true
    Dame de Saint-Louis ought to contrive to be with her
    class at all possible moments, even at the hours when she
    is not obliged to be there. And yet they think they are
    pleasing God by making a half-hour&rsquo;s orison which was
    not required of them, and deserting the employment of the
    time which He does demand in accordance with their vows!
    I should never end on this chapter, my dear daughter.
    Never give up on this point, I conjure you. It is for you
    to see that the rules are obeyed, and when your functions
    cease and you become again a simple mistress, set an
    example of fidelity to the others.</p>

<p>Do not let us complain, my dear sister, and fear the
    future; let us rather try to establish the present as best we
    can. You can contribute better than any one to this purpose,
    for you are sufficiently prudent not to vex the sisters;
    at the same time you will never allow the young ladies to
    speak in a low tone to one another. The sisters must excuse
    a great deal of poor talk that they will hear, and not
    reprove it when there is no real harm in it.</p>
<p>Mme. d&rsquo;Auxy [this was Jeannette de Pincré, an adopted
    daughter of Mme. de Maintenon] is quite beside herself
    when she has a new gown. She consults me about the
    trimming; I enter into it and give her my advice, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> her that her joy and liking for adornment belongs to her
    age, but that youth must pass, and that I hope she will
    come sooner or later to better inclinations. I think that
    such compliance does more good than severity, which serves
    only to rebuff the young and make them dissimulating.</p>
<p>I am told that one of the little girls was scandalized in
    the parlour because her father talked of his <i>breeches</i>. That
    is a word in common usage. What refinement do they mean
    by this? Does the arrangement of the letters form an immodest
    word? Do they feel distress at the words &ldquo;breed&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;breeze&rdquo; or &ldquo;breviary&rdquo;? It is pitiable. Others only whisper
    under their breath that a woman is pregnant; do they wish
    to be more modest than our Lord who talked of pregnancy
    and childbirth, etc.? One of the young ladies stopped short
    when I asked her how many sacraments there were, not
    being willing to name marriage. She began to laugh and
    told me they were not allowed to name it in the convent
    from which she came.</p>
<p>What! a sacrament instituted by Jesus Christ, which he
    honoured with his presence, the obligations of which his
    Apostles explained, and which we ought to teach to our
    daughters, must not be named to them! These are the
    things that turn a convent education into ridicule. There is
    much more immodesty in such proceedings than there is in
    speaking openly of what is innocent and with which all
    pious books are filled. When our young ladies have passed
    through marriage they will know that it is not a thing to be
    laughed at. They ought to be accustomed to speak of it
    very seriously and even sadly, for I think it is the state of
    life in which we suffer most tribulation, even in the best
    marriages. They should be taught, when occasion offers,
    the difference between immodest words, which must never
    be uttered, and coarse words,&mdash;the first being sinful, the
    second simply against good-breeding.</p>

<p>I think, my dear daughter, that being too much attached
    to one&rsquo;s body means fearing too much inconveniences and
    want of ease, being too particular about one&rsquo;s person, being
    easily disgusted with that of others, dressing with too much
    care, apprehending cold, heat, smoke, dust&mdash;in a word, all
    the little flesh mortifications&mdash;too much; it is desiring to
    satisfy our senses, seeking pleasure, being too much attached
    to our health, taking too much care of it, troubling ourselves
    about remedies, occupying ourselves with our own relief,
    being too nice about what we like and too fidgety about
    what we fear; it is examining ourselves on such points with
    too much care. Being too much attached to one&rsquo;s mind
    means to think we have one, to plume one&rsquo;s self upon it, to
    wish to increase it, to show it, to turn the conversation
    according to our own tastes, to seek out persons who have
    mind and despise others whom we think have none, to speak
    affectedly, and write the same.&mdash;But I am obliged to finish,

<p>In the year 1700 or 1701 I busied myself much with the
    classes, and we began to establish what is now practised with
    such great success. We should, however, renew our vigilance
    unceasingly, my dear daughter, and forbid the young
    ladies absolutely to say a single word in a low voice to their
    companions. This fault, which seems very slight to persons
    without experience, is really very considerable; and there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> none as to which you must be less indulgent. Punish it
    very severely, and let people say what they like. If the
    young ladies would reason about it for a moment themselves
    they would admit that they are whispering in order to say
    things that they know are not right; it is therefore very
    proper to forbid it.</p>
<p>We cannot feel sure of youth without this precaution;
    but after taking it, do not reprove them too severely for
    what you hear them say; strive to teach them to distinguish
    the good, the bad, the indiscreet, the imprudent, the immodest,
    the coarse; but always little by little, letting pass a
    number of things.</p>
<p>I see our mistresses shocked and alarmed when our girls
    desire finery and think themselves happy when they get a
    pink gown; a crime ought not to be made of that weakness
    of their age and sex; they should be told gently that such
    tastes will pass away, but not that they are sins. By such
    little concessions you will win their confidence the more.
    But I repeat: they must not whisper, and the mistresses, the
    blacks, and the flame-coloured ribbons must keep their eyes
    always upon them.</p>
<p>I pray God to make you know the value and sincerity of
    this vigilance, so that you may give yourself wholly to it;
    keep at a distance whatever can embarrass you, and watch
    continually, but quietly.</p>

<h3>CONVERSATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS OF MME. DE MAINTENON AT SAINT-CYR.</h3>
<p>[The following reports were written down by the mistresses,

    of being read and re-read by the mistresses in after days.]</p>

<p class="center"><i>Advice to the Young Ladies on the letters they write. Brevity
    and simplicity recommended.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> January, 1695.<br />
</p>
<p>As you order us to write down what was said yesterday
    at recreation we shall do so as exactly and simply as we can.
    Mme. de Maintenon was good enough to come here expressly
    to correct our letters, as our mistresses had begged her to do.
    She first made all the young ladies surround her, and those
    whose letters were to be corrected stood nearest to her. She
    showed them, one after another, the faults in those presented
    to her, making us particularly notice how a simple, natural
    style, without turns of phrase, was the best, and the one that
    all persons of intellect used; telling us that the principal
    thing in order to write well is to express simply and clearly
    what one thinks. She gave us as an example M. le Duc du
    Maine, whom she taught to write, when she had the care of
    him, by the time he was five years old. She related to us
    that having told him one day to write to the king, he
    answered, quite embarrassed, that he did not know how to
    write letters. Mme. de Maintenon said, &ldquo;But have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> nothing in your heart that you want to tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I
    am very sorry he has gone,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said,
    &ldquo;write that, it is very good.&rdquo; Next she said, &ldquo;Is that all
    you are thinking? have you nothing else to say to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad when he comes back,&rdquo; replied the
    Duc du Maine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is your letter made,&rdquo; said Mme. de
    Maintenon; &ldquo;you have only to write it down simply, as you
    think it; if you think badly, it will be corrected.&rdquo; She
    then said to us, &ldquo;That is how I taught him, and you have
    seen the charming letters that he writes.&rdquo; Mme. de Loubert,
    our head mistress, said it would be giving us great pleasure
    if she would take the trouble to write a model for us. She
    consented, and took for her subject the letters she had just
    corrected; she wrote a note and a letter in order to show us
    the difference.</p>
<p>We dared not show her the desire we had that she should
    write one for us as if to a person to whom we owed respect;
    one of our mistresses was so good as to say this for us.
    Mme. de Maintenon asked us, with her accustomed kindness,
    &ldquo;To whom, my children, do you wish me to address
    it?&rdquo; We answered her in a manner to let her know it
    should be to herself, as our benefactress. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said,
    &ldquo;since you wish it, I will write you a letter of ceremony and
    respect to aged persons, although they are not of better
    families than your own.&rdquo; Then, addressing one of us, she
    said: &ldquo;For instance, you owe respect to old M. T&mdash;&mdash;, your
    uncle, whom I know, though he is of the same family as
    your own; you also owe me respect on account of my age,&rdquo;&mdash;as
    if wishing to tell us there was no other reason to
    make us respect her, so great is her humility; but it does
    not become us, Mother, to speak to you of that, which you
    know better than we.</p>
<p>After having written the letter we had asked of her, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> had the kindness to read it to us, and then said: &ldquo;You see
    I have made it respectful and tender, but it is meant for
    those who regard me as a mother, just as I regard them as
    my daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have not as yet, Mother, received the letters she took
    the pains to write for us, but we shall try to obtain them
    soon, and will then give them to you, without changing
    anything.</p>
<p>We must also tell you what she made us notice as to the
    last words of her letter which express the tenderness she
    allows us to show her, having the charity to consider us her
    daughters. She said to us: &ldquo;If a person whom I did not
    know wrote to me thus it would not be proper, though I
    should not mind it; but as for those at Saint-Cyr, I like
    them to show me affection and write to me without
    ceremony....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before going away she said to us, &ldquo;My dear children,
    do you think that all this will profit you?&rdquo; We answered
    that we hoped the pains she had taken would not be wasted,
    and she went away saying that she wished the same with all
    her heart.</p>
<p>It is with much pleasure, Mother, that we have acquitted
    ourselves of what you ordered us; we beg you to excuse all
    the defects you may perceive in it; but we think there
    is no need to tell you how filled we are with gratitude to
    Mme. de Maintenon, who gives us daily fresh marks of her
    kindness. It is this which makes us hope for as fortunate
    a fate as that which has come to several of our companions
    who have been brought closer to her. We cannot hope
    that fate will do as much for us, but at least we are going
    to apply ourselves with all our strength to profit by the
    kindnesses which she now does us; and we shall endeavour
    all our lives to do honour to the education which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> procured for us, and in which she so often employs herself.
    We are, Mother, with profound respect, your very humble
    and very obedient servants,</p>

<p class="center"><i>On good and bad characteristics of mind.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> April, 1700.<br />
</p>
<p>On April 12 of the year 1700, Madame said to us during
    recreation: &ldquo;I fear you judge too much by what the young
    ladies who present themselves for the novitiate have done
    in the classes. You see a girl commit some considerable
    fault, perhaps many faults, and that is enough to prejudice
    you against her; this is not just. You ought to judge,
    both in good and evil, only by perseverance in them;
    because a girl who has kept to either throughout the
    classes proves that such is her character. I should, therefore,
    not oblige a girl who has done well throughout to
    make a long novitiate. And, without excluding a girl
    who did badly in the lower classes and seemed to change
    on entering class Blue, I should nevertheless prolong her
    novitiate so as to give her time to strengthen herself in
    good, if her change is sincere, and to test it if assumed; so
    that you may see if she has one of those fickle, inconstant
    natures which, it may be feared, will fall back after a time
    into its early defects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the things to which you ought to apply
    yourselves the most,&rdquo; continued Madame, &ldquo;is to know
    the character of your novices; it is very important to
    choose only sound ones; piety may cut off vices, but it
    seldom changes the defects that come from the character
    of the mind. As for me, I would rather have what you
    call here a naughty girl, who is often only frolicksome,
    than a captious mind or an ill-humoured one, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> pious. I rather like what are called naughty children,
    that is to say jovial, vainglorious, passionate, even a little
    headstrong, girls who chatter and are lively and self-willed,
    because all those defects are easily corrected by reason and
    piety, or even by age itself. But an ill-formed mind, a
    captious mind remains to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean,&rdquo; they asked her, &ldquo;by an ill-formed,
    captious mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mind,&rdquo; replied Madame, &ldquo;that does
    not yield to reason; that does not see results; believes
    always that one is trying to vex it, gives an evil turn to
    everything, and without being malignant takes things quite
    otherwise than as they are meant. But nothing is worse
    than a false spirit, a disguised and dissembling one, or an
    obstinate and opinionated one. Beware of those defects
    and of a bad temper; they are most troublesome in a
    community; for nothing makes the burden of government
    heavier than the management of difficult natures which
    require diverse treatment. God allows all these defects
    because such ill-formed natures can always be saved.
    He is,&rdquo; she added pleasantly, &ldquo;more indulgent than we;
    He receives many persons into His paradise whom I should
    be sorry to admit into our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mme. de Riancourt asked if being rather sulky was the
    same as being bad-tempered. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Madame,
    laughing. &ldquo;I would readily permit a little sulkiness;
    there are few children not subject to it; but their natures
    are not bad for all that. What I call a bad temper is that
    of a person easily affronted, suspicious, cavilling about an
    air, a look, a word,&mdash;in short, a person with whom one can
    never be a moment at one&rsquo;s ease; whereas a girl of a good
    spirit takes everything in good part, lets many things go
    by without taking them up; and, far from imagining that
    persons mean to attack her, when they are not dreaming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> it, does not even perceive a real intention to annoy; a girl
    who accommodates herself to everything, who finds facilities
    for doing whatever is wanted; a girl whom a superior can
    put without caution into any office and with all sorts of
    persons. That is what I call a good mind; it is a treasure
    to a community.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Mistresses ought to suit their conduct to the diverse natures.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> 1701.<br />
</p>
<p>On one of our working-days Madame said to us: &ldquo;You
    ask me to instruct you about your classes; experience will
    teach you more than I can tell you; it is less my own
    mind that has taught me what I know than the experiments
    I made myself in the days when I educated the princes.
    You should regulate your conduct to the various characters;
    be firm, but never find too much fault; you must
    often shut your eyes and see nothing, and above all take
    care not to irritate your girls and drive them indiscreetly
    to extremities. There come unlucky days, when they are
    upset, emotional, and ready to murmur; whatever you
    might then do in the way of remonstrance and reprimand
    would not bring them back to order. You must let things
    slide as gently as you can, so as not to commit your
    authority; and it will often happen that the next day
    the class will do marvels. Some children are so passionate
    and their tempers are so quick that were you to whip them
    ten times running you could not lead them as you wish.
    At such times they are incapable of reason, and punishment
    is useless; you must give them time to calm, and
    calm yourself; but in order that they may not think you
    give up to them and that by their obstinacy they have
    become the stronger, you must use dexterity, employ an
    intermediary, or say that you put off the affair to another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> time, which renders it more terrible; but do not think that
    they will be angry and passionate all their lives because
    in childhood their tempers are quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen this in M. le Duc du Maine; he is now the
    gentlest man in the world, but in his childhood, made irritable
    by illness and violent remedies, he was sometimes in a
    fury of impatience which every one reproached me for permitting.
    They used to put him into a boiling bath [<i>bain
    bouillant</i>], and because he screamed and was out of temper
    they wanted me to scold him; but I assure you I had not
    the courage; I would go away to write, or have myself
    called away, so that he might not think I tolerated his ill-temper
    (which, as I think, was very pardonable on such
    occasions); besides which, the remedies so heated his blood
    that all I could have said or done would not have calmed
    him. One must study the moments at which to take the
    means most suitable to children. Sometimes a look, a word,
    will bring them back to their duty; or a private conversation
    in which you can bring them to reason by speaking kindly
    with them. There are some that you must publicly rebuke,
    and sometimes often; there are others that you must punish
    instantly and not appear to spare. In short, discretion and
    experience can alone teach you the means you ought to take
    on all occasions; but you will never succeed unless you act
    with a great dependence on the spirit of God. You must
    pray to Him much for all those with whom you are intrusted;
    address Him in a special manner when you are
    puzzled, never doubt that He will help you as long as you
    distrust yourselves and are careful to keep yourselves united
    to Him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Questions on ideas of pleasure. Principle of conduct to
    follow in friendships.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> December, 1701.<br />
</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon asked Mlle. de la Jonchapt on what
    was the lesson of the day when she entered the class [of the
    Blues]. She replied, &ldquo;It was, Madame, on the ideas we
    form of pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mme. de Maintenon,
    &ldquo;what are yours; what would they be if you were no longer
    here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the young lady, &ldquo;I would like to
    be with my family, all assembled and all united.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You
    are right to consider that a pleasure,&rdquo; said Mme. de Maintenon,
    &ldquo;it is in the order of God; nothing is so lovable as a
    united family. And you, Laudonie, what would you like,
    when you are no longer here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, Madame, that I
    should find my pleasure in rendering service to my father
    and mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is also very right,&rdquo; said Mme. de
    Maintenon, &ldquo;every time that you think in that way, and do
    not look for greater pleasures, it may be said that you are
    very reasonable. But you do not sufficiently put into your
    plan that you will have to suffer. Expect that, my children,
    I implore you; nothing is so capable of softening ill-fortune,
    which may overtake you, as being prepared for it; always
    expect something worse than you have met with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There
    is one among them,&rdquo; said the mistress (it was Mme. de
    Saint-Périer), &ldquo;who tells me she expects her pleasure in
    going to see her friends and receiving them in her own
    house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; replied Mme. de Maintenon, &ldquo;there is
    much pleasure in living with our friends and conversing
    with open hearts, as we say, and no constraint. But there
    is,&rdquo; she added in a lower voice to the mistress, &ldquo;a pagan
    maxim, which I think very stern; it is to act with our
    friends as if we were sure they would some day be our enemies.
    I could secure myself, it seems to me, by letting my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> friends see nothing that was bad in me; I should try never to
    be wrong in their presence, nor in that of persons whom I
    loved less, because so many circumstances occur in life to separate
    us that friends often become enemies, and then we are
    in despair at having trusted them too much, and having
    spoken to them freely without reserve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mme. de Montespan and I, for example,&rdquo; she added, continuing
    to speak in a low voice to the mistress,&mdash;&ldquo;we have
    been the greatest friends in the world; she liked me much,
    and I, simple as I was, trusted her friendship. She was a
    woman of much intelligence and full of charm; she spoke
    to me with great confidence, and told me all she thought.
    And yet we are now at variance, without either of us having
    intended it. It is assuredly without fault on my side; and
    yet if either has cause to complain it is she; for she may say
    with truth: &lsquo;I was the cause of her elevation; it was I who
    made her known and liked by the king, and she became the
    favourite while I was dismissed.&rsquo; On the other hand, was
    I wrong to accept the affection of the king on the conditions
    upon which I accepted it? Did I do wrong to give him
    good advice and to try, as best I could, to break up his connections?
    But let us return to what I meant to say in the
    first instance. If in loving Mme. de Montespan as I loved
    her I had been led to enter in a bad way into her intrigues,
    if I had given her bad advice, either from the world&rsquo;s point
    of view or from God&rsquo;s, if&mdash;instead of urging her all I could
    to break her bonds&mdash;I had shown her the means of retaining
    the king&rsquo;s affection, would she not have in her hands
    at this moment the means of destroying me if she wished
    revenge? &lsquo;This (or that) person whom you esteem so
    much,&rsquo; she used to say to me, &lsquo;said to me thus and so; she
    urged me to do this, she counselled me that,&rsquo; etc. Have I
    not good reason to say that we should not let anything be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> seen even to our friends which they might use in the end
    against us? Sooner or later things are known, and it is very
    annoying to have to blush for things we have said and done
    in times past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, many years ago, to M. de Barillon [one of her
    oldest friends] that there was nothing so clever as to never
    be in the wrong, and to conduct one&rsquo;s self always and with all
    sorts of persons in an irreproachable manner; he thought I
    was right, and said that, in truth, there was nothing so able
    as to put one&rsquo;s self, through good conduct, under shelter from
    all blame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that one day the king sent me to speak to
    Mlle. de Fontanges; she was in a fury against certain mortifications
    she had received; the king feared an explosion and
    sent me to calm her. I was there two hours and I employed
    the time in persuading her to quit the king and in trying to
    convince her it would be a fine and praiseworthy thing to
    do. I remember that she answered me excitedly, &lsquo;Madame,
    you talk to me of quitting a passion as I would a chemise.&rsquo;
    But to return to myself, you must admit I had nothing to
    blush for, and no reason to fear it should be known what I
    had said to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot too strongly preach the same conduct to your
    young ladies; let them give nothing but good advice; teach
    them to act in the most secret and personal affairs as if a
    hundred thousand witnesses were about them, or would be
    later; for I say again, there is nothing that is not sooner or
    later known, and it is more Christian, more virtuous, safer,
    and more honourable to have been a noble personage only;
    and even if we remain forever ignorant of what has been the
    wisdom of our conduct, I think we ought to count for much
    the inward testimony of a good conscience.&rdquo; Then rising,
    she said to the class, &ldquo;Adieu, my children, I am obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> return to Versailles; but I have given my sister de Saint-Périer
    a fine field on which, to instruct you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>On contempt for insults and injuries.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> 1701.<br />
</p>
<p>On the last day of the year 1700, the community having
    said to Mme. de Maintenon that they hoped to bury with
    the past century all their old differences and be other than
    they had been in the coming one; and also that they begged
    her to pardon and forget the imperfections of the year 1700
    and those which had preceded it, &ldquo;The past year,&rdquo; she replied,
    &ldquo;has been fortunate enough; many things have been corrected
    and I now see in this establishment more of good
    than of evil. God grant that you advance as much the coming
    year; I hope it greatly, for He has given you good willingness;
    that is what he requires of us: &lsquo;Peace on earth to
    men of good will,&rsquo; said the angels. When this good will is
    real and sincere it does not remain useless, it produces infallibly
    its fruit; in some sooner, in others later. We must
    await the times and moments of God, not by remaining idle,
    but by working with good will, without discouragement and
    without uneasiness, leaving to God the care of blessing our
    labour. It is certain that He desires our perfection more
    than we do ourselves. He could make us perfect in a single
    day and all at once; but that is not His ordinary conduct;
    He defers, He touches the heart of one at this time, another
    may be touched at a future time. We must adore His designs
    and work in peace and confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dames de Saint-Louis having complained in the
    same conversation that they were not persecuted as other
    institutions had been at their birth: &ldquo;You will be,&rdquo; said
    Mme. de Maintenon, &ldquo;and you have been already, though
    the harm that is said of you may not come to your ears. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> pay no regard to it, nor to that which is said of me myself.
    I receive letters every day not only in the style of the person
    whom my sister de Butéry knows of, but letters which ask
    if I am not tired of growing fat by sucking the blood of the
    poor; and what I, being so aged, expect to do with the gold
    I am amassing. I receive other letters that go farther still
    and say to me the most insulting things; some of them warn
    me I shall be assassinated. But all this does not trouble
    me; I do not think it needs much virtue to feel no resentment
    for that sort of opposition. I said rather an amusing
    thing on a first impulse the other day to a poor woman, who
    came to me while I was surrounded by a number of the
    Court, weeping and imploring that I would get justice for
    her. I asked what wrong had been done to her. &lsquo;Insults,&rsquo;
    she said; &lsquo;they insult me, and I want reparation.&rsquo;
    &lsquo;Insults!&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;why, that is what we live on here!&rsquo;
    That answer made the ladies who accompanied me laugh.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;I think, Madame,&rdquo; said Mme. de Saint-Pars, &ldquo;that, far from
    enriching yourself at the expense of the poor, you run into
    debt for the charities you do.&rdquo; &ldquo;As for debts,&rdquo; she replied,
    &ldquo;I have none; but it often happens that I have no money;
    and when I settle my accounts at the end of the year I do
    not see how my income has been able to furnish all I have
    spent and given away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>On Civility.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> 1702.<br />
</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon having had the goodness to ask the
    young ladies on what topic they wished her to speak to
    them, Mlle. de Bouloc entreated her to instruct them on
    civility. She told them that civility consisted more in
    actions than in words and compliments; and there was but
    one rule to be given about it. &ldquo;It is in the Gospel,&rdquo; she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> &ldquo;which adapts itself so well to the duties of civil life. You
    know that our Lord said that we must not do to others what
    we would not wish them to do to us. That is our great rule,
    which does not exclude the proprieties in usage in the different
    regions where we may be living. As for what regards
    society, I make civility to consist in forgetting one&rsquo;s self and
    being occupied only with what concerns others; in paying
    attention to whatever may convenience or inconvenience
    them, so as to do the one and avoid the other; in never
    speaking of one&rsquo;s self; in listening to others and not obliging
    them to listen to us; in not turning the conversation to
    one&rsquo;s self or one&rsquo;s own tastes, but letting it fall naturally on
    that of others; in moving away when two persons begin to
    speak to each other in a low voice; in returning thanks for
    the smallest service and therefore of course for great ones.
    You cannot do better, my children, than to practise all these
    good manners among yourselves, and so acquire such a habit
    of them that they will soon become natural to you. I assure
    you that these attentions, and continual regard paid to the
    claims of others are what make a person pleasing in society;
    and they cost nothing to those who are well brought up.
    You have, for the most part, that advantage; put it therefore
    to profit, and you will be compensated for the self-restraint
    you will have to exercise in the beginning by the esteem and
    friendship these deferential manners will procure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>On never neglecting to learn useful things.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> 1702.<br />
</p>
<p>Madame having come to class Green and asking news of
    a certain young lady, the mistress told her she had given up
    plain-chant. &ldquo;Has she no voice?&rdquo; said Madame, &ldquo;well, we
    are alike in that. I never could sing an air, but I never
    hear one that I do not remember it, and after the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> hearing I feel all the mistakes that are made in it. I do
    sing sometimes when I am alone, and it gives me great
    pleasure, but I do not think it would give as much to others
    if they heard me. What effect does plain-chant have on the
    classes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are delighted to learn it, and it will be
    very useful to them,&rdquo; replied the mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, undoubtedly,&rdquo;
    said Madame; &ldquo;even if they cannot sing, they
    will get a little knowledge of singing, which will always give
    them pleasure. We should never neglect to learn anything,
    no matter what. I never supposed that learning to comb
    hair would be useful to me. My mother, going to America,
    took several women with her, but they all married there,&mdash;even
    to one old woman, frightfully ugly, with club feet.
    My mother was left with none but little slaves, who were
    quite incapable of waiting upon her, and especially of doing
    her hair. She then taught me to do it, and as she had a
    very fine head of very long hair I was obliged to stand on
    a chair; but I combed it extremely well. From there I
    came to Court, and this little talent won me the favour of
    Mme. la Dauphine; she was quite astonished at the way I
    could handle a comb. I began by disentangling the ends of
    the hair and went on upwards. The dauphine said she was
    never so well combed as by me; I did it often, because her
    waiting-women never could do it as well; they, the women,
    would have been sorry&mdash;if for nothing else&mdash;not to have
    had me there every morning. I think you have to comb each
    other&rsquo;s hair; and you ought not to make difficulties, or think
    it beneath you because you are young ladies. Many a day
    I have come here very early in the morning to comb the
    Reds and cut their hair and clean out the vermin. You
    are given the liberty to cut your hair; and cutting it makes
    it finer. I remember that my mother never saw me without
    putting her scissors to mine; and she succeeded in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> she intended, for I have still a great deal of hair on my
    head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I repeat, my children, that you should never neglect to
    learn everything you can learn. Nothing so marks the intelligence
    of a person as liking to see and learn how a thing
    is done. I am charmed with Jeannette; it is surprising that
    a child of her age should apply herself as she does; the
    other day she spent half an hour watching to see how a lock
    was put on; she looked it over in every way and gave her
    whole attention to it. Mme. la Duchesse de Bourgogne
    knows how to do every kind of work; I am often astonished
    by it. I think she must have been brought up like our
    princes, and that some waiting-woman, to pay her court,
    taught her these things. She does not need to learn any
    of the handicrafts wherever she is, for she knows them all;
    you could teach her nothing. Also, would you believe it?
    she understands about fevers; she feels my pulse when she
    thinks I am ill, and what she says about me is sure to be
    the same that M. Fagon says afterwards. She knows how
    to spin wool, flax, silk, how to use a spinning-wheel, how to
    knit, and she has lately embroidered for herself a gown of
    yellow taffetas. I used to spin myself; to please my governess,
    I spun her a gown. M. de Louvois knew all sorts of
    trades; he had enormously thick fingers, almost as large as
    two of my thumbs, and yet he could take a watch to pieces
    with wonderful nicety, though there is nothing more delicate
    to handle. He could be shoemaker, mason, gardener, etc.
    One day when I was winding silk on two cards, or squares, of
    a pretty shape, while he worked with the king in my room,
    he was dying of curiosity to know how the pretty thing that
    I held was made. The king noticed this, and told me in a
    low voice. I showed it to him; he unwound the silk, examined
    the card, and put it together again most adroitly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing that we have not, sometime or other, a
    need to know. In the days when I brought up the princes
    [Louis XIV.&rsquo;s children by Mme. de Montespan] it was necessary
    to keep them concealed; and for that purpose we were
    constantly changing our place of residence, and the tapestries
    had to be rehung each time. I used to mount the ladder
    myself, for I often had no one to help me and I dared not
    make the nurses do it; in that way I learned a trade I am
    sure I should never have learned otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was because you had great energy,&rdquo; said a mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied Madame, &ldquo;that I did have energy in
    my youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what is wanting to our young
    ladies,&rdquo; said the mistress; &ldquo;they are so tired with the least
    exertion that they can hardly walk round the garden without
    fatigue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought not to sit still a moment,&rdquo; said
    Madame; &ldquo;it is good to run, jump, dance, and play at base,
    skittles, and other games; it makes them grow. Perhaps
    that is the reason they are so short. It is amazing that at
    their age they do not like to be active, and that they want to
    be always sitting down or leaning upon something. Mme.
    de Richelieu at seventy years of age had never leaned back
    in her coach, and I myself, old and ill as I am, I am always
    as erect as you see me. I am glad when I see you sweeping
    and rubbing the floors of the church, because it is good for
    your health; if I could, I would make you run about all the
    time; but you cannot be educated while running. I do not
    understand why you should object to sweeping; it makes
    you strong. You ought not to object to help a servant; I
    have never seen pride on that point among the nobility,
    except at Saint-Cyr. I can understand perfectly well that
    beggars reclothed [<i>gueux revêtus</i>, the term in those days for <i>parvenus</i>] should not venture to touch the ground with the
    tips of their fingers; but nobles do not think such things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> beneath them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said a mistress, &ldquo;that you had
    the goodness to tell us once that you taught your nurse
    to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Madame, &ldquo;and sometimes she
    said she would not learn. I used to follow that woman
    about, and often I spent whole days sifting flour through a
    hopper; she would set me up upon a chair to do it more
    conveniently. It is very fatiguing work; I only did it to
    oblige my nurse. Since then God has raised me to great
    fortune and given me great wealth; but I have never loved
    money except to share it. I do not put my happiness into
    having fine petticoats, as you may see by the gowns I wear,
    but I put it into giving pleasure to others. You know that
    one of the maxims I have taught you is: The greatest of all
    pleasures is to be able to give pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she asked Mlle. de Brunet which was easier, to
    exact things from one&rsquo;s self, or from others. Mlle. de Brunet
    answered, &ldquo;From ourselves.&rdquo; Several other young ladies
    were questioned and thought the same. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo;
    said Mme. de Maintenon. &ldquo;I cannot understand how any
    one can think otherwise, because it seems to me more just
    and appropriate that we should inconvenience ourselves
    rather than inconvenience others; we ought always to be occupied
    in avoiding whatever may give pain to other people.
    Mme. la Duchesse de Bourgogne undertook a piece of work,
    to execute which she sent for a woman who embroiders, and
    this woman spent the whole of yesterday with her without
    her ever thinking of giving her anything to eat. I asked the
    woman in the evening if she had eaten; she said no, and I
    made her dine and sup both. The king, who is wonderfully
    attentive, reproved Mme. la Duchesse de Bourgogne severely;
    she tried to laugh it off, but he told her that he could not
    laugh at such a matter. I am convinced that that poor
    woman was not much pleased to find that while she worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> hard, those she worked for let her go hungry. If such a
    mark of inattention, which might be very pardonable in a
    young princess of sixteen, was rebuked by the king with
    such seriousness, how much more should girls like you who
    will have to spend all your lives in attentions to others need
    reproof if you neglect them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king always astonishes me when he speaks of his
    own education. His governesses amused themselves, he
    says, all day, and left him in the hands of the maids without
    taking any care of him&mdash;you know that he began to reign
    when he was three and a half years old. He ate whatever he
    could lay hands on, without any attention being paid to the
    injury this was to his health; it was this that accustomed
    him to so much carelessness about himself. If they fricasseed
    an omelet he snatched bits of it, which Monsieur and
    he went off into a corner to eat. He relates sometimes that
    he spent his time mostly with a peasant girl, the child of a
    waiting-maid of the queen&rsquo;s waiting-maid. He called her
    Queen Marie, because they played at the game, &lsquo;<i>à la madame</i>,&rsquo;
    she taking the part of queen, and he serving her as
    page or footman, carrying her train, wheeling her in a chair,
    or marching with a torch in front of her. You can imagine
    whether little Queen Marie gave him good advice, and
    whether she was useful to him in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>On never omitting either labour or pains.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> July, 1703.<br />
</p>
<p>I am very much pleased, my dear children [of class Yellow],
    to find in you as much docility and the same simplicity
    that there is in the younger classes; and for this I give you
    great praise. I wish to talk with you now on the precautions
    which you take to avoid too much labour and trouble.
    It seems that some of you think you can exempt yourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> from the common lot and avoid suffering the slightest discomfort;
    but you will find that what you have to suffer now
    is nothing at all in comparison with what you will meet with
    in the world. There is no one who does not suffer. I have
    long had the honour of seeing the king very closely; if any
    one could shake off the yoke and have no cares or troubles
    it would surely be he; and yet he has them continually.
    Sometimes he spends the whole day in his cabinet going
    over his accounts; I often see him cracking his brains over
    them, beginning them over and over again, and not leaving
    them till he has finished them all; and this duty he never
    devolves upon a minister. He relies on no one but himself
    for the regulation of his armies; he possesses a knowledge of
    the number of his troops and regiments in detail, like that
    which I possess of the divisions in your classes. He holds
    several councils a day, where business that is often vexatious
    and always wearisome is transacted; such as that of war,
    pestilence, famine, and other afflictions. He has now the
    government of two great kingdoms; for nothing is done in
    Spain except by his order. The King of Spain has no money,
    because of the laziness of his subjects; their land is much
    more extensive than that of France, but it brings in nothing
    because it is not cultivated. All this is an additional care
    to our king; he can scarcely take any pleasure; business
    absorbs all his time. And yet if there is a condition which
    might be supposed exempt from toil and fatigue, it is that
    of royalty. The ministers, whose places are so coveted and
    envied (though without reason), well deserve the profits of
    their offices from the pains and fatigues they have to endure
    in them. M. de Chamillart is working perpetually; there
    is no longer even a question of relaxation for him, still less
    of pleasure; he cannot see his family, whom he loves passionately,
    because he has not a moment to give it, being from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> morning till night engaged in disagreeable affairs and trying,
    for example, to make out whether Peter or John is in
    the right. People fear he will fall ill, and he is very much
    changed; he sent for his daughter, to marry her, but he
    cannot even see her. Yet that is a man whom everybody
    thinks fortunate.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>On marriage.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> 1705.<br />
</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon, having married Mlle. de Normanville
    (who had stayed with her some years after leaving
    Saint-Cyr) to M. le Président Brunet de Chailly, did her
    the honour to be present at the wedding. The next day
    she mentioned to the Dames de Saint Louis that M. l&rsquo;Abbé
    Brunet had made an excellent exhortation in marrying
    them, in which he rebuked the over-delicate modesty of
    those who blamed priests for opening their lips in church
    about a sacrament there administered, which Jesus Christ
    has instituted, which Saint Paul declares to be great and
    honourable; while at the same time their ears are not too
    scrupulous to listen outside of the church to love-songs,
    and speeches of questionable meaning. &ldquo;This false delicacy
    is one of the blunders,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I do not wish
    to see you fall into, my dear daughters. Nearly all nuns
    dare not utter the word &lsquo;marriage&rsquo;; Saint Paul had no such
    scruple, and speaks of it very openly. I have noticed this
    weakness in you, and I should like to destroy it once for
    all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Mme. de Jas, &ldquo;that we usually
    pass over that article in the Catechism; we consulted the
    Superior to know if we should use it; we did not even
    mention it in the choir until you told us we ought to
    speak of it as of all other matters in the Catechism, when
    occasion offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not see, my dear daughters,&rdquo;
    resumed Mme. de Maintenon, &ldquo;that it is a notion quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> unsustainable in a house like this that you cannot venture
    to speak of a state which many of your young ladies must
    enter, which is approved by the Church, which Jesus Christ
    himself honoured by his presence? How will you make
    them capable of properly fulfilling the duties of the several
    states to which God calls them if you never speak of them;
    and (what is worse) if you let them see the difficulty which
    you feel in speaking of such things? There is certainly
    less modesty and propriety in such feelings than in speaking
    seriously and in a Christian manner of a holy state
    which has great obligations to meet. Fear only that the
    omissions your pupils make through ignorance of the duties
    of that state may fall on you who have failed to instruct
    them in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the kindness, Madame,&rdquo; said Mme. de Jas, &ldquo;to
    tell us a little in detail what it is proper for us to say to
    them on that subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot preach to them too
    much,&rdquo; replied Mme. de Maintenon, &ldquo;about the edification
    that each will owe to her husband; also the support, the
    attachment to his person and all his interests, the service
    and cares that depend upon her; above all, the sincere and
    discreet zeal for his salvation, of which so many virtuous
    women have set an example, as well as of that of patience;
    also the care of the education of children which extends
    so far into the future; and that of servants and household;
    all of which are much more indispensable duties for mothers
    of families than prayers of supererogation, which many of
    them have been taught to make, to the injury of the more
    important duties of their condition. When you speak of
    marriage to your young ladies in this way, they will see
    that there is nothing in it to laugh about. Nothing can
    be more serious than such an engagement. Establish it,
    therefore, as a system, to speak to them on this subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> when it presents itself; and do not permit that, under a
    pretence of modesty and perfection, the name of marriage
    shall not be mentioned; that silly affectation, if I may
    venture to so express myself, will cast you down very low
    into the pettiness I have taken such pains to make you
    avoid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>On the virtues called cardinal.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> June, 1705.<br />
</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon, being in class Blue, talked to the
    young ladies of the cardinal virtues, but first she said that
    the word &ldquo;cardinal&rdquo; was taken from a Latin word signifying
    hinge, because, just as a door turns on its hinges, so the
    whole conduct of our lives should turn on the four virtues
    which include all others. She exhorted them to love them,
    and not think it was enough to know how to define them,
    but to practise them, in order all the sooner to gain merit.</p>
<p>Mlle. de Villeneuve asked her in what &ldquo;merit&rdquo; consisted.
    She answered: &ldquo;In having an assemblage of virtues and
    good qualities, and, above all, religion and reason.&rdquo; Then
    she explained Justice; saying that justice in action consists
    in rendering to every one that which is due to him,
    and consenting that others should render to us what we
    deserve. &ldquo;What do we deserve when we do wrong? Mlle.
    de Laudonie, answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We deserve blame,&rdquo; answered the
    young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mme. de Maintenon, &ldquo;and it
    is therefore justice to suffer ourselves to be blamed when
    we do wrong; that is one of the best ways of repairing
    our faults; there is no one who cannot act justly in that
    way. It is the mark of a good mind to recognize our
    faults and admit them. On the other hand, it is the mark
    of a very small mind not to be able to see and admit that
    we are wrong, and to seek for false excuses to cover it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She next said that besides that sort of justice, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> ought to be found in our actions, there was one of judgment,
    called equity, which so works that, without being
    influenced by our inclinations or dislikes, it obliges us to
    form just ideas on all things, to distinguish good from evil
    (even to seeing the faults of friends without being blinded
    in their favour by affection), and to recognize in good faith
    the good qualities which may exist in persons whom we
    like least and who are even unpleasant to us. &ldquo;Not,&rdquo; she
    said, &ldquo;that we are obliged to disclose the faults of our
    friends; because friendship demands that we should cover
    and excuse them unless it is necessary to stop an evil by
    disclosing them; but justice requires that we should judge
    to be bad that which is bad, and good that which is good,
    independently of our inclinations either way in respect to
    the persons concerned. The first and surest rule to avoid
    being mistaken in our judgments is to conform them as
    nearly as possible to those of God, which are shown to us
    in Holy Scripture and in the Gospel; and the second rule,
    which is also drawn from the Gospel, is to judge others as
    we wish that they should think and judge of us, and to
    treat them in all things as we should wish to be treated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is still another degree of justice more excellent
    than these and which demands a very different kind of virtue:
    it is <i>unselfishness</i>, which makes us capable of deciding
    against ourselves in favour of those who have right on their
    side. There are many persons sufficiently equitable to judge
    justly about the cases of others; but as soon as they themselves
    are interested we find them biased in their own favour.
    That is not justice, for justice insists that we shall declare
    for the right on whichever side it is found. The king did
    a praiseworthy action, which has been much admired as to
    this. Some time ago he had a lawsuit against certain private
    persons in Paris who had believed, the ramparts of the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> being greatly neglected, that they were free to appropriate a
    piece of land and build upon it. Many years after they had
    done so the officers charged with the king&rsquo;s revenue reflected
    that as that land belonged to him, the houses that were built
    upon it ought also to belong to him, or at least that he ought
    to be paid the value of the land on which they were built.
    The private persons contended that the long time they
    had been in possession was a sufficient title to make the
    property theirs. The affair was carried to the king and
    judged in his presence; half of the judges were for him,
    half declared for the other side, which was very praiseworthy,
    the king being present. Now it is a law of the
    kingdom, in suits thus judged before the king according to
    plurality of opinions, that in case of an equal division he
    shall give the casting vote; it depended therefore on the
    king himself to win his case; but instead of doing so he gave
    his vote to the opposite side, saying that, inasmuch as there
    were good reasons on both sides, he preferred to relinquish
    his rights rather than press them farther to the injury of his
    subjects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now pass to Prudence. That is a virtue that rules
    all our words and actions according to reason and religion;
    it enables us to discern what we should do or omit doing, say
    or keep silence about, according to occasions and circumstances;
    it is opposed to the indiscretion of speaking out of
    season.&rdquo; Thereupon she asked Mlle. de Saint-Maixant what
    she considered most contrary to charity, to ridicule a person
    for corporal defects, or for defects of mind or temper. The
    young lady answered, &ldquo;To ridicule defects of mind or heart.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;It is never right to ridicule any defects,&rdquo; said Mme. de Maintenon;
    &ldquo;charity enjoins us to excuse all; but I think that it is
    base and cruel to blame a person for a natural defect which he
    has had no share in producing, and which he cannot correct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> Good hearts and minds are incapable of laughing at such
    defects; they endure them and ignore them out of care and
    tenderness for those who have them. But I should think it
    more excusable to blame a defect of mind or temper; for,
    after all, the person who has it could correct it, or at least
    diminish it; therefore that person is blamable to give way
    to it. Nevertheless, charity forbids us to reproach him for
    that as well as for the other. One means of avoiding the
    indiscretion which is so disagreeable in society is to become
    prudent, to reflect on what we are about to say, in order to
    foresee whether it will have any evil result or give pain to
    others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prudence also induces us to consult those who are wise
    and experienced; it makes us take judicious measures to
    carry out that which we undertake to do; and it teaches us
    to undertake nothing that is not judicious, and has not a fair
    appearance of success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temperance is a virtue which moderates us in all things,
    and makes us keep the golden mean between too much and
    too little. It should be in continual use; it prevents all
    excitements of passion, whether of joy or sadness; if we
    laugh, it is with moderation and modesty; if we weep, it is
    not as delivering ourselves up entirely to grief, but as bearing
    it peaceably and patiently; if we eat, it is with moderation;
    in short, temperance prevents excess in all things.
    Temperance is to you, who are here, very necessary on all
    occasions, because the foible of youth is to be carried away
    by joy and pleasure; everything turns the head of youth
    and prevents it from possessing itself, unless it takes great
    care to control this tendency. Remember carefully what I
    am about to say to you: every person who is not mistress
    of herself will never have merit, whether before God or before
    the world. She must be mistress of her joy and not give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> way to fits of laughter, to excessive demonstrations; all joy
    shown by postures of the body is immoderate, and, consequently,
    opposed to temperance. We should never hear a
    modest and well brought-up young person laugh noisily; the
    Holy Spirit, as you know, says Himself that the laugh of a
    fool is known because he laughs loudly, but the wise man
    laughs beneath his breath because he is master of all his
    motions and knows how to moderate them. And yet everything
    puts you beside yourselves. If the ball rolls into <i>trou
    madame</i> [a game] that is enough to make you shout and
    scream with laughter; and still more if you win the game.
    I do not condemn a little joy on such occasions, but it should
    not go so far as immoderate shouts and losing your self-possession.
    We break the Reds of such uproars of joy, how
    much therefore should you, who ought to be more reasonable,
    break yourselves of this habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortitude is a virtue which makes us pursue our enterprises
    with courage, and surmount the obstacles we find in
    ourselves and others to the good we have undertaken, without
    giving way before difficulties; sustaining all unfortunate
    events with firmness and without discouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which of us is the virtue of fortitude most necessary,
    Beauvais?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the one who has most defects and those
    most difficult to conquer,&rdquo; replied the young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,
    I think as you do,&rdquo; said Mme. de Maintenon. Then she
    added: &ldquo;Should those who have the most defects, or who feel
    they are not so well-born, be discouraged and imagine they
    can never succeed in conquering them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Madame,&rdquo;
    said the young lady, &ldquo;because our merit depends on our
    efforts aided by the grace of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is an admirable
    answer,&rdquo; said Mme. de Maintenon; &ldquo;never forget it, my
    children; our merit depends upon our effort. With that
    good word I leave you, but we will talk of it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><i>On making excuses and inappropriate answers.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> 1706.<br />
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, my dear children,&rdquo; said Mme. de Maintenon to
    the young ladies, &ldquo;that I could rid you of your tendency to
    make excuses. I know it is very natural, and it forms a
    religious penance not to make excuses, even when unjustly
    blamed. But that is not what I require of you; I ask you
    only, on such occasions, to listen respectfully and tranquilly
    to what your mistresses say to you, and when they have
    ended ask them, in a gentle and modest way, to allow you
    to give your reasons&mdash;provided they are good, for it is a
    thousand times better when you are wrong to acknowledge
    it than to make a single bad excuse.... I like a girl infinitely
    more who sometimes does wrongful things and owns
    it frankly and seems sorry for the trouble she occasions,
    than another who usually does right but refuses to acknowledge
    a fault when she happens to commit one. I have often
    admired Mme. la Duchesse de Bourgogne, who is the first
    princess in the land and over whom I, naturally, have no
    authority; you would scarcely believe with what docility,
    what good spirit, what gratitude she receives the advice I
    take the liberty to give her. But, more than that, I found
    her the other day sitting on the stairs outside the door of
    my room with Jeanne, a coarse village-woman of good sense
    whom I have in my household, who was telling her of her
    faults and what she heard said to her disadvantage in Paris;
    and that charming princess, instead of being offended by the
    frankness of the good woman, threw her arm round her
    neck and kissed her several times, saying: &lsquo;I am very much
    obliged to you, Jeanne; I thank you for all that you have
    told me, for I know it is out of affection to me.&rsquo; And whenever
    she sees her now she is not only friendly but she kisses
    her heartily, though she is old and ugly and disgusting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><i>On the taste for dress.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> 1708.<br />
</p>
<p>A mistress having said to Madame that some of the young
    ladies had shown publicly before their companions their delight
    in being well-dressed, and had said they could not conceive
    of a greater pleasure and that nuns withered with
    grief at seeing persons who were thus dressed, ... Madame
    said: &ldquo;I cannot sufficiently tell you, my children, what pettiness
    there is in this desire for adornment, though it is
    natural in persons of our sex. It is, however, so humiliating
    that those who care for their reputation, even in the great
    world, should be careful not to show that weakness if they
    have it, for it makes them despised by all; the most worldly
    persons, on the contrary, esteem young ladies who despise
    their beauty and do not affect to improve it by dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I exhort you sometimes to endeavour to please, I
    mean that it shall be by good conduct, and not by fine
    clothes; sorrow to those who seek to distinguish themselves
    in that way! If they are not sensitive to the distress of
    offending God, a love of their own honour should put them
    above this foible; for the world turns to ridicule those in
    whom it sees the desire to appear beautiful, especially when
    they are not so really. Those who have beauty and seem to
    disregard it are, on the contrary, much esteemed. I wish,&rdquo;
    added Madame, sighing, &ldquo;I had done as much for God as I
    have for the world to preserve my reputation. In my youth
    I persisted, in the midst of the highest society, in wearing
    nothing but simple serge, at a period when no one wore it;
    I was more singular in my dress than a young lady of Saint-Cyr
    would be now in the midst of the Court.&rdquo; Mme. de
    Champigny asked her if it was from fear of pleasing that she
    dressed so modestly. &ldquo;I was not happy enough,&rdquo; she replied,
    &ldquo;to act in that way from piety; I did it from reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> and for the sake of my reputation. I had not means enough
    to equal others in the magnificence of their clothing; so I
    preferred to throw myself into the other extreme and prove
    that I was above all desire to make a show by apparel and
    adornment, rather than let it be thought I snatched at what
    I could, and did my best to equal them. I could not tell
    you what esteem such conduct won me; people never tired
    of admiring a pretty young woman who had the courage, in
    the midst of society, to keep to such modest apparel; that is
    just what it was; but there was nothing vulgar or repulsive
    about it; if the stuff itself was simple, the gown was well-fitting
    and very ample, the linen was white and fine, nothing
    was shabby. I made more of an appearance in that way
    than if I had worn a gown of faded silk, like most of the
    poor young ladies who try to be in the fashion and who have
    not the means to pay for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also maintained with inviolable firmness a disinterested
    determination to receive no presents; I was so well known
    for that characteristic that no man ever presumed to offer
    me any, except one, who was foolish. I do not know what
    made him do the thing I will now tell you: I had an amber
    fan, very pretty; I laid it for a moment on a table; and this
    man, whether as a joke or from design, took it up and broke
    it in two. I was surprised and angry; I liked my fan very
    much, and to lose it was a great regret to me. The next day
    the man sent me a dozen fans the equals of the one he had
    broken. I sent him word it was not worth while to break
    mine in order to send me a dozen others, for I should have
    liked thirteen fans better than twelve, which I returned to
    him, and remained without any fan at all. I turned the
    man to ridicule in company for having sent me a present, so
    that no one after that ever offered me one. You cannot
    think what a reputation this proceeding gave me; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> was so jealous of maintaining it that I would gladly have
    done without everything rather than act otherwise. Such
    love of reputation, though it may be mixed with pride and
    arrogance, and should consequently be corrected by piety, is
    nevertheless of great utility to young ladies; it is a supplement
    to piety, which protects them from many disorders.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>What pains and ennui there are in all states of life.</i></p>
<p class="sig"> 1710.<br />
</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon, having had fever all night, and
    having it still, went up to class Blue and said to them: &ldquo;I
    have dragged myself here to see you, my children, in order
    that you may tell me what you have remembered of the
    fine conference you had yesterday with M. l&rsquo;Abbé Tiberge&rdquo;
    [one of the confessors of Saint-Cyr]. The young ladies
    repeated it, and when they came to the part where he told
    them there were troubles in every state of life she took up
    the subject and enlarged upon it, saying: &ldquo;That is true
    indeed, beginning first with the Court people, whom the
    world considers so fortunate. There is nothing more burdensome
    than the life they lead; it costs them infinite trouble,
    constraint, expense, and ennui to pay their court; and at
    the end of it all you will hear them say: &lsquo;Ah! how vexed
    I am; I have stood about since morning and I think the
    king has not even seen me.&rsquo; And, in truth,&rdquo; continued
    Mme. de Maintenon, &ldquo;they get up very early in the morning,
    dress with care, and are on their feet all day, watching for
    a favourable moment to make themselves seen and be presented;
    and often they come back as they went, except that
    they are in despair at having wasted both time and trouble.
    But I wish you could see the state of the fortunate ones;
    that is to say, those who see the king and have the honour
    to be in his intimacy; there is nothing to equal the ennui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> that consumes them. We are now at Meudon, a magnificent
    palace. Well! every one must go to walk, without liking to
    do so, in a dreadful wind perhaps, out of respect to the king.
    They come back very tired, and you will see a number of
    women complaining and saying: &lsquo;How weary I am! this
    place will kill us all.&rsquo; &lsquo;I cannot bear it,&rsquo; says another; &lsquo;if
    I could only walk with some one whom I like, but no! I
    find myself in file with some one who makes me die of
    weariness.&rsquo; For no one can choose her companion any
    more than you can here; she must go with whoever presents
    himself. The fact is,&rdquo; said Mme. de Maintenon, &ldquo;they do
    not really know what to do, and nothing gives them any
    pleasure. Fête-days are the most wearisome of all for those
    who are not pious; they do not know how to while away
    the time. A few ladies are fortunate enough to like to
    spend those days, as they should, in church; others who like
    to work are vexed not to dare to do so; others again, who
    like neither church nor work, find those days intolerably
    wearisome. You see, my dear girls, how it is with the
    greatest of the earth; for I am speaking now of princes and
    princesses, the very first persons of the Court, and those who
    are the envy of the rest of the world. They are usually
    not contented anywhere; they are bored by dint of seeking
    pleasure; they go from palace to palace, Meudon, Marly,
    Rambouillet, Fontainebleau, in hopes of amusing themselves.
    All these are delightful places, where you, my children,
    would be enchanted if you saw them; but these people are
    bored because they are used to it all. In the long run the
    finest things cease to give pleasure and become indifferent;
    besides, such things do not make us happy; happiness must
    come from within.... As for me, whose favour every one
    envies because I pass a part of my day with the king,&mdash;they
    think me the most fortunate person in the world; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> are right, so far as the goodness with which his Majesty
    honours me; and yet there is no one more restrained. When
    the king is in my room I often sit apart from him because
    he is writing; no one speaks, unless very low, in order not
    to disturb him. Before I came to Court, at thirty-two years
    of age, I can truly say that I never knew ennui; but I have
    known it enough since, and I believe that I could not bear it,
    in spite of my reason, if I did not feel that it is God who
    wills it. If you had to sit in my chamber and never say a
    word for a portion of your lives you would quiver with impatience,
    would you not? And yet, in spite of all I tell you,
    my post is envied. There is no true happiness my children,
    except in serving God; piety alone can sustain us and give
    us an equable behaviour, in the midst of pains and tedium
    as well as in the midst of prosperity, which is a state no
    less dangerous to our salvation.&rdquo;</p>

    COURT;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> WITH A FEW MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Madame said to me [1705], &ldquo;in great joy whenever
    I see the door closing behind me as I enter here; and I
    never go out of it without pain. Often, on returning to
    Versailles, I think: &lsquo;This is the world, and apparently the
    world for which Jesus Christ would not pray on the eve of
    his death. I know there are good souls at Court, and that
    God has saints in all conditions; but it is certain that what
    is called the world is centred here; it is here that all passions
    are in motion,&mdash;self-interest, ambition, envy, pleasure; this
    is the world so often cursed by God.&rsquo; I own to you that
    these reflections give me a sense of sadness and horror for
    that place, where, nevertheless, I have to live.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>After speaking with Madame of various afflicting things,
    I said to her that at least she would see none in this house,
    for all was going on so well it ought to be a place of rest to
    her, where she could take comfort for what she suffered
    elsewhere. &ldquo;That is just so,&rdquo; replied Madame, &ldquo;and what
    should I do without this house? I could not live. I think
    that God has given it to me, not for my salvation only, but
    for my rest; it does not serve me only to pray to God and
    gather myself together, but it diverts my mind; it makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> me forget those other things. When I am here, and busy,
    when we hold counsel together or I talk with the young
    ladies, I do not even think there is a Court, and I breathe
    freely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought this morning,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when I saw
    you taking the communion, that it may have been long since
    you had such a morning, when you could pray to God at
    your ease and collect yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied
    Madame. &ldquo;I have told you often that the only time I can
    take for my prayers and the mass is when other people
    sleep; without it, I could not go on; for when people once
    begin to enter my room I am not my own mistress; I have
    not an instant to myself.&rdquo; I replied, as to that, that I
    always imagined her room to be like the shop of a great
    merchant, which, once opened, is never empty and where
    the shopman must remain. &ldquo;That is just how it is,&rdquo; said
    Madame. &ldquo;They begin to come in about half-past seven;
    first it is M. Maréchal [the king&rsquo;s surgeon]; he has no
    sooner gone than M. Fagon enters; he is followed by M.
    Bloin [the king&rsquo;s head valet] or some else sent to inquire
    how I am. Sometimes I have extremely pressing letters to
    write, which I must get in here. Next come persons of
    greater consequence: one day, M. Chamillart; another, the
    archbishop; to-day, a general of the army on the point of
    departure; to-morrow, an audience that I must give, having
    been demanded under such circumstances that I cannot
    defer it. M. le Duc du Maine waited the other day in my
    antechamber till M. Chamillart had finished. When M.
    Chamillart went out M. du Maine came in and kept me till
    the king arrived; for there is a little etiquette in this, that
    no one leaves me till some one of higher rank enters and
    sends them away. When the king comes, they all have to
    go. The king stays till he goes to mass. I do not know if
    you have observed that all this time I am not yet dressed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> if I were I should not have been able to say my prayers. I
    still have my night-cap on; but my room by this time is
    like a church; a perpetual procession is going on, everybody
    passes through it; the comings and goings are endless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the king has heard mass he returns to me; next
    comes the Duchesse de Bourgogne with a number of ladies,
    and there they stay while I eat my dinner. You would
    think that here at least was a time I could have to myself;
    but you shall see how it is. I fret lest the Duchesse de
    Bourgogne should do something unsuitable; I try to make
    her say a word to this one; I look to see if she treats that
    one properly, and whether she is behaving well to her husband.
    I must entertain the company, and do it in a way
    to unite them all. If some one commits an indiscretion I
    feel it; I am worried by the manner in which people take
    what is said to them; in short, it is a tumult of mind
    that nothing equals. Around me stand a circle of ladies,
    so that I cannot even ask for something to drink. I turn
    to them sometimes and say: &lsquo;This is a great honour for me,
    but I would like to have a footman.&rsquo; On that, each of them
    wants to serve me and hastens to bring me what I want;
    but that is only another sort of embarrassment and annoyance
    to me. At last they go off to dine themselves, for my
    dinner is at twelve o&rsquo;clock with Mme. d&rsquo;Heudicourt and
    Mme. de Dangeau, who are invalids. Here I am at last
    alone with those two; every one else has gone. If there
    were a moment in the day when I might what is called
    amuse myself, this is it, either for talk or a game at backgammon.
    But usually Monseigneur takes this time to come
    and see me, because on some days he does not dine, on other
    days he has dined early, and so comes after the others. He
    is the hardest man in the world to talk with, for he never
    says a word. But I must try to entertain him because I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> in my own apartment; if it were elsewhere I could lean
    back in a chair and say nothing if I chose. The ladies who
    are with me can do that if they like, but I must, as they say,
    labour it out, and manage to find something to say; and
    this is not very enlivening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the king&rsquo;s dinner is over, he comes with all the princesses
    and the royal family into my room; and they cause it
    to be intolerably hot. They talk; the king stays about half
    an hour; then he goes away, but no one else; the rest remain,
    and as the king is no longer there they come nearer to me;
    they surround me, and I am forced to listen to the jokes of
    Mme. la Maréchale de Clérembault, the satire of this one, and
    the tales of that one. They have nothing to do, those good
    ladies; and they have done nothing all the morning. It is
    not so with me, who have much else to do than to sit there
    and talk, probably with a heart full of care, grief, and distress
    at bad news, like that from Verrue lately. I have
    everything on my mind; I am thinking how a thousand
    men may be perishing, and others in agony.... After they
    have all stayed some time they begin to go away, and then
    what do you suppose happens? One or other of these ladies
    invariably stays behind, wishing to speak to me in private.
    She takes me by the hand, leads me into my little room,
    and tells me frequently the most unpleasant and wearisome
    things, for, as you may well suppose, it is not my affairs
    that they talk about; they are those of their own family:
    one has had a quarrel with her husband; another wants to
    obtain something from the king; an ill turn has been done
    to this one; a false report has been spread about that one;
    domestic troubles have embroiled a third; and I am forced
    to listen to all this, and the one among them whom I like
    least does not restrain herself more than the others,&mdash;she
    tells me everything; I must be told all the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> and speak about them to the king. Often the Duchesse de
    Bourgogne wants to speak to me in private, like the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this makes me think sometimes when I reflect upon
    it that my position is so singular it must be God who
    placed me in it. I behold myself in the midst of them all;
    this person, this old person of mine, the object of all their
    attention. It is to me they must address themselves, to me,
    through whom all passes! God has given me grace never
    to look at my position on its splendid side. I feel nothing
    but the pains of it; it seems to me that, thank God! I am
    not dazzled; He enables me to see it just as it is. I do not
    allow myself to be blinded by the grandeur and the favour
    that surround me; I regard myself as an instrument which
    God is using to do good, and I feel that all the influence He
    permits me to have should be employed in serving Him, in
    comforting whom I can, and in uniting these princes with
    one another, if possible. I think sometimes of the hatred
    that I have instinctively for the Court; it is nothing new;
    I have had it always. God, nevertheless, destined me to be
    there; why, then, has He given me this aversion to it? It
    must be because He wills that I should live in its midst and
    find my salvation there. Mme. de Montespan, on the contrary,
    loved the Court, not only for the ties that held her
    to it, but because she liked Court life. What does God do?
    He binds to it the one who hates it, He sends away from it
    the one who loves it, apparently for the salvation of both.
    Ah! how good it is to let Him act, to abandon ourselves to
    Him, to live from day to day doing all the good we can. He
    knows better what we want than ourselves; and, assuredly,
    He is an excellent director; we need only to yield ourselves
    to His guidance. But let us go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the king returns from hunting he comes to me;
    then my door is closed and no one enters. Here I am, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> alone with him. I must bear his troubles, if he has any, his
    sadness, his nervous dejection; sometimes he bursts into
    tears which he cannot control, or else he complains of illness.
    He has no conversation. Then a minister comes, who often
    brings fatal news; the king works. If they wish me to be
    a third in their consultation, they call me; if they do not
    want me I retire to a little distance, and it is then that I
    sometimes make my afternoon prayers; I pray to God for
    about half an hour. If they wish me to hear what is said
    I cannot do this; I sit there, and hear perhaps that things
    are going ill; a courier has arrived with bad news; and
    all that wrings my heart and prevents me from sleeping at
    night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the king continues to work I sup; but it is not
    once in two months that I can do so at my ease. I feel that
    the king is alone, or I have left him sad, or that M. Chamillart
    has almost finished with him; sometimes he sends and
    begs me to make haste. Another day he wants to show me
    something. So that I am always hurried, and the only thing
    I can do is to eat very fast. I have my fruit brought with
    the meat to hasten supper; and all this as fast as I can. I
    leave Mme. d&rsquo;Heudicourt and Mme. de Dangeau at table,
    because they cannot eat as fast as I do, and often I am
    oppressed by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this it is, as you may suppose, getting late. I have
    been about since six in the morning; I have not breathed
    freely the whole day; I am overcome with weariness and
    yawning; more than that, I begin to feel what it is that
    makes old age; I find myself at last so weary that I can no
    more. Sometimes the king perceives it and says: &lsquo;You are
    very tired, are you not? You ought to go to bed.&rsquo; So I go
    to bed; my women come and undress me; but I feel that
    the king wants to talk to me and is waiting till they go; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> some minister still remains and he fears my women will hear
    what he says. That makes him uneasy, and me too. What
    can I do? I hurry; I hurry so that I almost faint; and
    you must know that all my life what I have hated most is
    to be hurried. At five years of age it had the same effect
    upon me; I was faint if I ran too fast, for being naturally
    very quick and consequently inclined to haste, I was also
    very delicate, so that to run, as I tell you, choked me. Well,
    at last I am in bed; I send away my women; the king
    approaches and sits down by my pillow. What can I do
    then? I am in bed, but I have need of many things; mine
    is not a glorified body without wants. There is no one there
    whom I can ask for what I need; not a single woman. It is
    not because I could not have them, for the king is full of kindness,
    and if he thought I wanted one woman he would endure
    ten; but it never comes into his mind that I am constraining
    myself. As he is master everywhere, and does exactly
    what he wishes, he cannot imagine that any one should do
    otherwise; he believes that if I show no wants, I have none.
    You know that my rule is to take everything on myself and
    think for others. Great people, as a rule, are not like that;
    they never constrain themselves, they never think that others
    are constrained by them, nor do they feel grateful for it,
    simply because they are so accustomed to see everything
    done in reference only to themselves that they are no longer
    struck by it and pay no heed. I have sometimes, during my
    severe colds, been on the point of choking with a cough I
    was unable to check. M. de Pontchartrain, who saw me one
    day all crimson with the effort, said to the king: &lsquo;She cannot
    bear it; some one must be called.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king stays with me till he goes to supper, and about
    a quarter of an hour before the supper is served M. le
    Dauphin, M. le Duc and Mme. la Duchesse de Bourgogne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> come to me. At ten o&rsquo;clock or a quarter past ten everybody
    goes away. There is my day. I am now alone, and I take
    the relief of which I am in need; but often the anxieties
    and fatigues I have gone through keep me from sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I expressed to Madame how trying all that seemed to me,
    and said I should not be surprised if some one should speak
    of her as the most unhappy person in the world. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo;
    she added, &ldquo;could they not also say, &lsquo;She is the happiest.
    She is with the king from morning till night?&rsquo; But they do
    not remember, in saying that, that kings and princes are men
    like other men; they have their griefs and troubles which
    we must share with them. Moreover, there are a thousand
    things that our princes never think of which fall upon me.
    For example, Mme. la Princesse des Ursins is about to return
    to Spain; I must busy myself with her; I must repair as
    best I can by my attentions the coldness of the Duchesse de
    Bourgogne, the stiffness of the king, the indifference of others.
    I go to see her; I give her time with me; I listen to a
    thousand matters I do not care about; and all that merely
    that she may go away pleased with others, and say good of
    them, especially of the Duchesse de Bourgogne. I see they
    are all too negligent to do this for themselves; I must supply
    the want; and so with a thousand other things. I have
    always on my mind Spain nearly lost to us, peace receding
    farther than ever, miseries that I hear of on all sides, thousands
    of persons suffering before my very eyes and I not
    able to help them,&mdash;and then, besides these sorrows, the
    excesses that reign at Court, drunkenness, gluttony, excessive
    luxury, and, worst of all, the visible dangers to religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked Madame if she were not sometimes impatient;
    she answered: &ldquo;Ah! indeed yes, I am; I am often, as they
    say, up to my throat in it; but it must be borne; and
    besides, God has arranged it. When I reflect on my condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> and how burdened I am with cares and griefs, I think:
    &lsquo;How would it be with my soul if this were not so? If, with
    this magnificence, wealth, and luxury, I had nothing to pain
    me, would anything on this earth be so likely to ruin me? A
    grandeur like this, if combined with ease of life, would soon
    lead me to forget God. I am lodged like the king; my
    furniture is magnificent; I am in luxury; but God shows
    his mercy throughout all that by mingling with it pains and
    distresses which serve as a counterpoise and make me turn
    to Him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our dear princess [Duchesse de Bourgogne] is fairly
    well; she is too anxious about the war for a person of her
    age. M. le Duc de Bourgogne is always pious, amorous,
    and scrupulous; but he is becoming every day more reasonable.
    I have no one to speak with, and I think that spares
    me many sins; for my confidences would be neither favourable
    to nor honourable for my neighbours. The men are
    all on bad terms with me, and the women I pay no heed
    to. Adieu, my dear duke. It is not necessary to urge
    you to zeal for the king and State; you act from principles
    that cannot change; and if you do not meet with all the
    gratitude you deserve, you will receive a more solid reward
    hereafter.</p>

<p>I can only add that our princess is taking great care to
    carry her child to the end. She is fairly well, but extremely
    sad. She has an affection for her father, but feels a great
    resentment to him; she loves her mother tenderly, and
    takes as great an interest in the affairs of Spain as in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> of France. She loves the king, and never sees him more
    serious than usual without the tears coming into her eyes;
    and with her excessive kindness she interests herself also
    in my pains and woes. I should like to comfort her, but,
    on the contrary, I distress her. This is a terrible state for
    a person of her age, and one who has, I think, without
    speaking of it, much uneasiness about her approaching confinement,
    and many fears lest she should have a girl.</p>

<p>I have just been witness of a conversation between the
    king and M. le Dauphin which has caused me great pain.
    I spend my life in trying to unite them and in warding
    off everything that is likely to cause misunderstandings
    between them, and yet here they are on the verge of
    quarrelling about a trifle. Monseigneur wanted to give
    a public ball to which society in general should be admitted;
    he was absolutely determined about it, and with
    him the Duchesse de Bourgogne. The king, with charming
    gentleness, opposed it, and told Monseigneur it was
    not proper, if he wished the Duchesse de Bourgogne to
    be present, that all sorts of men and women should be
    present also. The princess, on her side, could see no harm
    in it, for she is just as ready to dance with a comedian as
    with a prince of the blood. I cannot tell you how this
    little squabble has made me suffer, and what a night I
    have passed. I blame myself for my too great sensibility,
    and yet, on the other hand, it seems to me I am right to
    desire peace in the royal family and to dread, between a
    king of seventy and a dauphin of forty-six, whatever may
    set them against each other and add to our general war a
    civil one.</p>

<p>Our king is tranquil, gentle, and equable in temper, such
    as you left him. His health is very good; his occupations
    the same as ever; it would really seem as though nothing
    had happened to give him pain [reference to disasters in
    war]. This is something surprising, which amazes me
    constantly.</p>
<p>Our princess makes great efforts to amuse herself, and
    only succeeds in making herself giddy with fatigue. She
    went yesterday to dine at Meudon followed by twenty-four
    ladies; after that they were to go to the fair and see some
    famous rope-dancers, return to sup at Meudon, and play
    cards, no doubt, till daybreak. She must have come home
    this morning,&mdash;ill perhaps, certainly serious, for that is the
    usual result of all her pleasures.</p>

<p class="sig"> <span class="smcap">Saint-Cyr</span>, Saturday, July 16, 1707.<br />
</p>
<p>It is in order that I may speak to you, madame, of the
    Duchesse de Bourgogne, that I have asked you to put off
    your visit to Paris till to-morrow. The king said to me
    last evening that he had been much surprised to hear of
    the card-playing at Bretesch [a village between Marly and
    Versailles]. I saw by that that the Duchesse de Bourgogne
    had deceived me. She told me that Mme. la Duchesse
    had invited herself to supper, but I see now it was a
    prearranged party, for the king tells me that the princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> herself invited Mme. la Duchesse, and that M. de Lorges
    was the first to arrive. I answered that it was quite
    natural that Mme. la Duchesse should sup at her brother&rsquo;s
    house, but that as for the cards, I was more sorry than
    any one.</p>
<p>The king said, &ldquo;Is not a dinner, a cavalcade, a hunt, a
    collation enough for one day?&rdquo; Then he added after a
    while, &ldquo;I should do well to tell those gentlemen they are
    not paying their court well in gambling with the Duchesse
    de Bourgogne.&rdquo; I said that <i>lansquenet</i> had always troubled
    me, for fear she might make some trip that would do her
    harm and put her on a bad footing. We talked of other
    things and then the king returned to the subject and said
    to me, &ldquo;Should I not do better to speak to those gentlemen?&rdquo;
    I replied that I thought that manner of acting
    might be injurious to the Duchesse de Bourgogne, and
    that he had better speak to her herself, so that the matter
    might remain secret. He said he should do so to-day;
    and I have begged you to remain in order that you may
    warn her. We have now come sooner than I expected to
    the alienation I have all along apprehended. The king
    will think he has vexed her by stopping her <i>lansquenet</i> and
    will be more stiff with her; she will certainly be vexed
    and be cold with him; I shall feel the same and return
    to the formal respect I owe to her; but I am not yet
    detached enough from the esteem of the world to consent
    to let it think I approve such conduct. [We know already
    how the sweet temper of the princess took these rebukes
    and turned away wrath.]</p>
<p>The Duchesse de Bourgogne will be compassionated by
    Mme. la Duchesse; which makes me remember the traps
    that her mother [Mme. de Montespan] used to lay for the
    queen and Mme. de la Vallière, in order to make the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> notice later what their behaviour had been. If after speaking
    to the princess you could come out to Saint-Cyr I should
    be glad; but I doubt whether, after so painful a conversation,
    you will be in a state to appear. If you find it possible
    to approach the Duchesse de Bourgogne you might give her
    this letter to prepare her for answering the king, and then
    you can speak to her in the evening more at length. You
    can imagine, madame, what a night I have passed. Let us
    pray God for our princess, who is drowning herself in a glass
    of water.</p>

</p>
<p>You know now, madame, that our happiness has not lasted
    long. The reduction of Ghent to the power of his Catholic
    Majesty had placed us in a situation of great advantage,
    which ought to have been maintained through the rest of
    the campaign; the enemy were on the retreat and quite
    disheartened. M. de Vendôme, who believes what he wishes,
    chose to give battle and lost it [Oudenarde], and we are
    worse off now than we were before, as much from fear of
    consequences and the air of superiority assumed by the
    enemy as from the loss of our troops.</p>
<p>In this condition we have felt the joy of the taking of
    Tortosa much less [taken by the Duc d&rsquo;Orléans, July 11],
    though we see all the value of it. Madame is delighted, and
    with good reason; she sees M. le Duc d&rsquo;Orléans covered
    with glory, and out of the danger to which he was exposed.</p>
<p>You know, madame, the levity of Frenchmen, and it
    seems to me that their talk is reaching you. Ghent, they
    are now saying, put us in a condition to make peace on any
    terms we chose; now all is lost, and we have to ask it with
    a cord round our necks. And yet, madame, neither statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> is true. The enemy had great resources though we
    had Ghent; we should have had more if M. de Vendôme
    had chosen to act with more precaution. Our army is still
    very fine and very good, the troops have done their duty,
    they are in nowise discouraged, and are now asking only to
    redeem themselves; but that they must not be allowed
    to attempt except with the order and caution to be observed
    on such occasions. The Duc de Bourgogne has held
    the wisest opinions, but he was ordered to yield to M. de
    Vendôme as being more experienced. Our princes have
    been in a position to be captured; imagine, madame, where
    we should then have been. That is a comfort I try to give
    to the Duchesse de Bourgogne in the extreme distress she
    feels. She shows throughout these sad events the feelings
    of a true Frenchwoman, such as I have always known her to
    feel; but I own I did not think that she loved M. le Duc de
    Bourgogne to the point we now see. Her tenderness goes
    even to delicate sentiment; she keenly feels that his first
    battle has proved disastrous; she would like him to have
    been as much exposed as a grenadier, and then to have come
    back to her without a scratch. She feels, too, <i>his</i> pain for
    the troubles that have happened; she shares the uneasiness
    that his present position must give him; she would like a
    battle, in order to have him win, and yet she fears it.
    Nothing escapes her; she is worse than I. This affliction
    which, in one aspect, gives me some pleasure because it
    proves her merit, gives me also great uneasiness about her
    health, which seems to have changed. Milk had done her
    some good and her fine colour was returning; but all these
    troubles distress her; and she is capable of prolonged grief;
    we saw after the death of Monsieur how long she felt it;
    and she is still feeling it.</p>

<p>We are awaiting the dispensation from Rome to marry
    the Duc de Berry; there would be many things to write
    you about that if prudence did not restrain me; but it is
    time to have a little of that virtue. There will be no fêtes,
    rejoicings, or expense; all will be done with regard to the
    present condition of affairs....</p>
<p>Our tall Princesse de Conti is greatly afflicted by the
    death of the Duchesse de la Vallière. She is hurt that the
    king has not been to see her; but he thought he ought not
    to renew a matter of which he repents daily. The princess
    no longer conceals her piety, and she sets a great example to
    the Court with much sense and courage. We shall go to
    Marly immediately after the wedding; I have some impatience
    to see two little rooms next the chapel, which the king
    has given me that I may go and rest sometimes, and get
    away from the annoyance of visitors in the morning.</p>
<p>The Duchesse de Bourgogne becomes more sensible every
    day. She is to be trusted with the feeding and education of
    the Duchesse de Berry, who for some time to come is not to
    have an establishment of her own. People are beginning to
    say, however, that a contract of marriage cannot be made
    without giving an appanage; and the king may give them
    that which Mme. de Guise once had. No one has ever seen
    a better household than that of the Duc and Duchesse
    d&rsquo;Orléans; they are never apart, and they take all their
    pleasures together. It is thought that Mme. de Saint-Simon
    will be lady of honour.</p>
<p>The whole talk now is of the new chapel [the present
    chapel at Versailles]; every one is rushing from all parts to
    see it; it is magnificent; I have not enough good taste to
    judge as to the rest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

    in the vicissitudes of this world. Adieu, Monsieur le Duc.</p>

    increased terribly and finally killed her February, 1714, just
    two years after her sister&rsquo;s death.] I entreat you, madame,
    to send me news of her condition.</p>
<p>You must allow me, madame, to pour out to you my feelings
    about the Duchesse de Bourgogne. After having borne
    with much discussion as to the bad system I had pursued
    in her education; after being blamed by all the world for
    the liberties she has taken in running about from morning
    till night; after seeing her hated by some for never saying
    a word, and accused of horrible dissimulation in the attachment
    she has shown to the king and the goodness with
    which she honoured me, I see her to-day with all the
    world chanting her praises, believing in her good heart, also
    in her great mind, and agreeing that she knows well how to
    hold a large Court to respect; I see her adored by the Duc
    de Bourgogne, tenderly beloved by the king, who has just
    placed her household in her own hands to manage as she
    likes, saying publicly that she is capable of governing much
    greater things. I tell you of my joy about all this, madame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> convinced that you will be glad of it, for you were the first
    to discover, sooner than others, the merits of our princess.</p>
<p>Mme. la Duchesse de Berry is still a child; her husband
    loves her passionately. M. le Dauphin said last night that
    he himself was the man in the world who had made the
    most good husbands. May God preserve them all.</p>

</p>
<p>We have no courier to-day, madame; perhaps he is delayed
    by the floods that surround us on all sides. For a
    month it has rained every day and all night too; but no
    matter, we are soon apparently to have peace. The passports
    have been sent; the Dutch are beginning to change
    their ideas; Philippe V. and his amiable descendants will
    reign securely on the throne of Spain; I have always hoped
    for a miracle in his favour: and <i>we</i> shall profit by what is
    now to happen to him&mdash;which he has deserved far more
    than we. I still hope, old as I am, to see the King of England
    return to his kingdom.</p>
<p>What glory for our king, madame, to have sustained a
    ten years&rsquo; war against all Europe, endured the misfortunes
    which arose, experienced famine and a species of pestilence
    that carried off millions of souls, and now to see it end in a
    peace which places the monarchy of Spain in his family, and
    re-establishes a Catholic king in his kingdom&mdash;for I will
    not doubt that that will follow upon peace. The king is
    blest with a health which makes me hope he will long enjoy
    the rest he is now to have. I think you sufficiently a
    Frenchwoman (in spite of all my insults) to rejoice with us.</p>
<p>Mme. la Dauphine takes eagerly to this subject of joy;
    she revels in it to its fullest extent; she imagines the happiness
    of her mother, and often talks to me of that of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> queen. She intends to do something on the day peace is
    concluded that she has never done before in her life and
    never will do again; but she has not yet found out what it
    shall be. Meantime she is going to the Te Deum at Notre-Dame,
    to dinner with the Duchesse du Lude in a beautiful
    new house, after that to the opera, and to sup with the
    Prince de Rohan in that magnificent hôtel de Guise, then
    cards and a ball all night, and as the hour of her return will
    be that of my waking, she will probably come and ask me
    for some breakfast on arriving. I think, madame, that you
    would find such a day rather long in spite of its pleasures.</p>
<p>M. le Comte de Toulouse was extremely well until the
    twenty-first day after the operation, when the king went to
    see him, and the whole Court, with French indiscretion, went
    also, which threw him into a fever.</p>

</p>
<p>I do not know, madame, if the courier of to-day will bring
    me letters from you; but I have one by M. de Torcy&rsquo;s
    courier and another by the last courier to answer.</p>
<p>It is true, madame, that Madame la Dauphine does greatly
    regret her youth; there is, however, ground to hope that
    she will always amuse herself, for she has within her a fund
    of inexhaustible joy; and if we are fortunate enough to
    have peace, it is probable that she will always be very happy.
    Her great gayety does not prevent great sympathy in trouble;
    she has keenly felt the uncertainty which the King and
    Queen of Spain have borne; she suffers much on account of
    her father; but there is no Frenchwoman more attached to
    the welfare of this country than she; so that I think she
    never can be held in when all these subjects of distress are
    lifted from her. She has reason to be happy; she is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> married, much beloved by the king and dauphin, and she
    truly makes the enjoyment of the whole Court. There
    are days when she has attacks of fever, and then the courtiers
    are in consternation, and cry out about the irreparable
    loss she would be to them. The people love her much
    because she lets herself be seen very readily; she has the
    most pleasing children she could possibly desire, less handsome
    than yours, but very vigorous, and perfect pictures,&mdash;graceful
    like herself, and showing already much intelligence.</p>
<p>If we may judge of the king&rsquo;s life by the present state of
    his health we may hope that it will last as long as that of
    the Marquis de Mancera, for their <i>régime</i> is about the same;
    there is no retrenchment in the meals that you know of; no
    diminution in the fine appearance, the habit of walking, in
    fact the whole figure, which you know, madame, is superior
    to that of all others. M. le Grand, who eats as much as the
    king and is much younger, is broken down with rheumatism,
    and can hardly drag himself about. M. de Villeroy always
    looks finely, but his sobriety does not save him from gout;
    M. le Duc de Grammont never has a day&rsquo;s health. These
    are the contemporaries and the strongest men of his time.</p>
<p>You will probably hear of a little scene with the Duchesse
    de Berry, who gives much anxiety to Madame, and to the
    Duchesse d&rsquo;Orléans. We must hope for some change in a
    young person only sixteen years old. Why, madame, do you
    speak to me of respectful attachment? Are you not, as it
    were, making game of me? You owe me, madame, merely
    a little friendship in return for the sentiments I have for you.
    I beg you to place me at the feet of the king and queen;
    and to believe that I shall esteem and love you all my life;
    I do not think that in saying that I am wanting in respect.</p>

</p>
<p>I do not know, madame, how I shall have strength to
    write you of the horrors that surround us. Measles are
    making great ravages in Paris. M. de Gondrin was buried
    yesterday; his wife has measles and continued fever with a
    dead child in her body; she wants to rise at every moment
    and go to her husband, who they dare not tell her is dead.
    Mme. la Dauphine has an inflammation in the head, which
    gives her a fixed pain between the ear and the upper end of
    the jaw; the place of the pain is so small that it could be
    covered by a thumb-nail. She has convulsions and screams
    like a woman in childbirth, and with the same intervals.
    She was bled twice yesterday and has taken opium three
    times, and seems a little more quiet at this moment. I am
    now going to her; and will close this at the last moment
    to give you the latest news.</p>
<p> Seven o&rsquo;clock at night.<br />
</p>
<p>Mme. la Dauphine, having taken a fourth dose of opium
    and chewed and smoked tobacco, feels a little easier. They
    have just come to tell me that she has slept an hour, and
    hopes to sleep a long time.</p>
<p>[The dauphine died February 12, the dauphin February
    18; and their eldest son, the Duc de Bretagne, March
    8, leaving the infant Duc d&rsquo;Anjou (Louis XV.) as the sole

<p>You will have heard the unhappy news; it is such that
    I cannot tell it to you in detail. The grief of the king is
    too great. All France is in consternation. My own state
    must not hinder me from thinking often of their Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> Majesties; I beg you, madame, to assure them of this. The
    King of Spain loses a saint in losing his brother; the queen
    is fortunate in never having known our dauphine [she was
    a little child when Marie-Adélaïde left Savoie]. Adieu,
    madame; I am quite unable to write you any details.</p>

</p>
<p>To put your mind at ease, monsieur, I have taken copies
    of all your writings [found among the dauphin&rsquo;s papers], and
    I send them all to you, without exception. Secrecy would
    have been kept, but circumstances might arise to reveal
    everything. We have just passed through a sad experience.
    I should have liked to return to you all the letters from
    yourself, and from M. de Cambrai [Fénelon], but the king
    desired to burn them himself. I own to you that I regret
    this much, for nothing was ever written so beautiful and so
    good. If the prince we mourn had a few defects it was not
    because the counsel given him was too timid, nor yet that
    he was too much flattered. It may be said that those who
    walk straight can never be confounded.</p>

<p>You are very good, madame, to think of me in the great
    event that has just happened [death of Louis XIV., September
    1, 1715]. We can but bow our heads beneath the hand
    that strikes us.</p>
<p>I would with all my heart, madame, that your condition
    were as happy as mine. I have seen the king die like a
    saint and a hero; I am in the most pleasing retreat I could
    desire; and wherever I am, madame, I shall be, all my life,
    your very humble and very obedient servant.</p>

</p>
<p>It is true, madame, that I have withdrawn from the world
    as much as possible, and that if my friends were a little less
    kind to me, I should henceforth see no one. But it is true
    also that I do not forget those I have esteemed, loved, and
    honoured, and that I think very often of you, wishing for
    you that which I believe to be the best of all things. I supposed,
    madame, that you would go to Rome, and I am very
    glad that you have done so for the sake of your eyes. Mine
    have had a different fate. I have left off the spectacles I
    began thirty-five years ago to wear, and I now work tapestry
    day and night&mdash;for I sleep but little. My retreat is peaceful
    and most complete. As for society, one can have none
    with persons who have no knowledge of all that I have seen
    and who have been brought up in this house and know
    absolutely nothing but its rules.</p>
<p>There is no state on earth, madame, that does not have its
    troubles; your good mind, your courage, and your blood have
    always diminished yours. Our Maréchal de Villeroy scarcely
    ever sees me now; but he does me kindnesses every day of
    his life. He is the refuge of the miserable. You would be
    satisfied with the public opinion of his merit; I know men
    who do not like him who, nevertheless, cannot help admitting
    that he makes a noble personage.</p>
<p>Believe me, madame, that I can never forget the marks of
    your goodness to me, and that I shall die with the same
    attachment as ever to you.</p>
